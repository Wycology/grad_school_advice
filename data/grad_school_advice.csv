video,text
1,hi everyone my name is Justin I'm a
1,postdoc at the Joslin Diabetes Center in
1,Harvard Medical School this channel is
1,called grad school advice it's designed
1,for students that are gonna be starting
1,grad school that are in grad school or
1,that are looking for a postdoc or even
1,just start of their postdoc and I'm
1,gonna be trying to give you as much
1,advice as I can about how to be a
1,successful grad student and to find that
1,really top-level postdoc position so I
1,hope you subscribe like any of the
1,videos that you find interesting and
1,yeah I'll catch you in the next
2,hi everyone back with another video so
2,today what we're gonna talk about is an
2,overview of grad school so this applies
2,to a PhD more than a master's but we'll
2,also talk about a master's a little bit
2,so the three components that I would
2,really break grad school into our the
2,classes that you're gonna have to take
2,the preliminary or qualifying exams that
2,you'll have to take and your
2,dissertation plus kind of break down
2,each one of these and kind of give an
2,overview about how each one of these
2,work and how it's different than what
2,you may have experienced before so the
2,first one are classes so everyone's
2,taking classes in high school college
2,but grad school classes are a little
2,different so the way most departments
2,will do grad school classes is that you
2,will have to take X amount of credits
2,that are general that everyone in the
2,department takes so if you're in a
2,molecular biology department these may
2,be things like genetics biochemistry and
2,you need to also take some credits that
2,are more specialized so it's similar to
2,College where if you're a biology major
2,or a chemistry major you may take sort
2,of general science classes and then more
2,specialized as you move up and so this
2,works the same way as you move up you
2,may need to take more Physiology or
2,molecular ontology for example and the
2,way these classes work is that you
2,generally need to have a certain GPA
2,overall so in my department when I was a
2,graduate student you needed to have a
2,3.0 GPA overall some departments are
2,stricter and have a 3/5 but there's
2,usually a grade-point requirement and
2,it's important to meet this requirement
2,but what you're gonna find is that there
2,are some differences between grad school
2,classes and undergrad classes so if you
2,go to a larger University you're
2,probably used to undergrad classes that
2,have 100 or more students in them
2,sometimes smaller but in grad school
2,you're gonna be in classes that are much
2,much smaller you may only have 10 kids
2,in a class and this is important because
2,unlike undergrad where you may have been
2,able to not attend classes and grad
2,school you really need to attend every
2,single class the other big difference is
2,that at least in my experience I felt
2,that the classes an undergrad were
2,actually harder than they were in grad
2,school an undergrad you're more
2,responsible for knowing more of the fine
2,details in a grad school it's more about
2,big picture how does everything fit
2,together and the other difference is
2,that because a PhD is a research-based
2,program a lot of your exams are also
2,going to focus on experimental design as
2,well so for example if you took cell
2,biology in college you probably remember
2,there's a whole section on protein
2,trafficking so protein trafficking to
2,the mitochondria etc and in undergrad
2,they may have asked questions
2,specifically about how does that
2,trafficking work in a grad school
2,they'll probably ask similar questions
2,but they're also going to ask
2,experimental questions if you believe
2,that protein acts is traffic from point
2,A to point B how do you test that
2,experimentally and these are things to
2,keep in mind as you prepare for your
2,class is that these are some of the
2,questions that you may be asked
2,another important thing to note is that
2,unlike undergrad where classes is your
2,only thing that you have to do in grad
2,school people tend to be a little bit
2,more
2,I wouldn't say lenient on classes but
2,it's not the focus nobody when you're
2,applying for a postdoc is gonna ask what
2,was your GPA in in grad school it just
2,isn't gonna happen so your GPA in grad
2,school is gonna be important for making
2,sure that you can pass to move to the
2,next step and also for some other things
2,for example if you apply for an f32
2,which is a fellowship that you could get
2,as an early postdoc come through NIH
2,they may ask for what your grad school
2,grades were but other than that your
2,grades are not as important so my
2,personal advice is that you should work
2,hard in your grad school classes I don't
2,think anyone should blow off their
2,classes and I think that they do serve a
2,purpose and it is important to do well
2,in them but what you're going to find is
2,that most P is are going to really focus
2,on the research aspect so that the
2,classes kind of takes care of the first
2,part now once you've completed your
2,classes and your advisor will tell you
2,that you need to complete X amount of
2,credits and that these things need to be
2,met once you've met all these
2,requirements you're then ready to take
2,what are called your preliminary or
2,qualifying exams and this is something
2,that varies greatly between departments
2,so I'm gonna kind of try to cover the
2,spectrum of how qualifying exams work so
2,qualifying or preliminary exams are a
2,way to test your ability to think and to
2,weed out people that should not really
2,be in grad school now typically each
2,grad department has a different failure
2,rate sometimes it's one kid a year maybe
2,doesn't pass sometimes it's 50% of
2,people don't pass it kind of depends on
2,where you are but your qualifying exams
2,or preliminary exams or sometimes
2,they're called Qualls or prelims I'll
2,typically refer to them as prelims
2,because that's what
2,they were called to my department they
2,kind of fall into two categories a
2,written category and a oral category so
2,let's talk about the written category
2,first so further written this is done
2,differently so sometimes in some
2,departments what it will be is it will
2,be all of the faculty in that department
2,will write questions that are kind of
2,the same to everybody and all of the
2,questions will be answered over a course
2,of a few days so instead of doing
2,research or classes you take three days
2,say and you sit in a room and you take
2,these tests and the professors will
2,grade them and they will give a score
2,back to your main Pio that's one way the
2,way that it was done in my department
2,was that every p.i on your committee and
2,we'll talk about forming a committee in
2,another video but but just real briefly
2,your committee is sort of the gatekeeper
2,that they decide how you pass your
2,prelims and they decide how you pass
2,your dissertation they're very important
2,I'm going to dedicate a whole video to
2,them so the way it typically worked in
2,my department was you it would have five
2,committee members including your PI and
2,each one would write a few questions for
2,your prelim and they were geared towards
2,the research that you were working on
2,and so each day you would go meet with
2,that one member on your committee they'd
2,give you your questions you'd spend a
2,whole day working on their questions and
2,so it was a five day exam and the way it
2,typically works is there's a minimum
2,threshold so in my department and other
2,departments around me it was you needed
2,to score 80% to past if you didn't get
2,an 80% you had to retake that part and
2,if you didn't pass a second time than
2,you were out and now this is where
2,there's big variation between
2,departments
2,so some departments you need an 80% to
2,pass and if you don't pass you have to
2,take the whole thing over again whereas
2,my department it was just that one part
2,also what varies is the amount of I
2,guess help or suggestion you get from
2,faculty so I passed mine on the first
2,time so this didn't apply to me but I
2,know many people who didn't and for the
2,people that didn't a lot of times the
2,professors in my department were very
2,helpful they would say well you didn't
2,pass because of X Y & Z and this is kind
2,of what you need to improve on to pass
2,the next time some departments don't
2,really give you that guidance they kind
2,of just marked down your score and
2,you're left to your own devices to
2,figure it out
2,but once you do pass your prelims you
2,have one last part which is an oral
2,component and a lot of people will refer
2,to this as your proposal now what if
2,what is a proposal think of this is the
2,if you think about your dissertation as
2,a final paper that you publish your
2,proposal is sort of the grant that
2,you're writing to do the project so this
2,is where you sit down with your
2,committee and you introduce to them the
2,topic that you're gonna be researching
2,why it's important what preliminary data
2,you've already generated and kind of
2,what are your aims so m1 a1 b2 a2 b2 C
2,etc and you outline what it is that you
2,want to do and you give a presentation
2,that's you know about an hour in length
2,and afterwards the professors on your
2,committee are gonna ask questions and a
2,lot of the questions although they can
2,be about general science a lot of the
2,questions are gonna be geared towards
2,the research so what will you do if
2,experiment X and aim 1a doesn't work how
2,will you go about that
2,what are alternative strategies so these
2,are things that you should be keeping in
2,mind as you prepare and we'll make an
2,entire video dedicated to your prelims
2,into your oral proposal because these
2,are very important parts of your
2,graduate school experience an area that
2,frankly a lot of students really
2,struggle with more than the desert
2,itself so this is an area we're gonna
2,focus heavily on and then after that you
2,are no longer just you know a graduate
2,student now you're a PhD candidate
2,you've been admitted to candidacy once
2,you pass this part so what does that
2,mean
2,that means that you are sometimes
2,referred to as abd all the dissertation
2,it means all that you have left in your
2,requirements is to fill out a sheet that
2,says I've done my dissertation hours and
2,you need to write your dissertation and
2,defend it and so the dissertation what
2,is a dissertation and again we'll have
2,an entire video dedicated to what is a
2,dissertation because this is a really
2,important thing so your dissertation is
2,the accumulation of all the research
2,that you've done throughout graduate
2,school and you put it together and it
2,gets bound up into a nice book and
2,dissertations for PhDs typically range
2,from a hundred to 250 pages so I've seen
2,them anywhere in there I think mine was
2,a hundred sixty or a hundred seventy
2,pages and the dissertation is going to
2,encompass a general introduction that's
2,typically 20 to 40 pages of kind of the
2,scope of the field and where you
2,envision your work fitting into that
2,field and a lot of times it gets written
2,in a very grandiose way but it's sort of
2,highlighting where your work fits in and
2,then you'll have your research that all
2,gets smashed in there with your methods
2,or results and then you're gonna have an
2,overall discussion how does your
2,research fit into the grander scheme of
2,things and once you've written that
2,you'll submit it to your committee and
2,you'll have your defense date and your
2,defense date you'll give a presentation
2,about the research that you've done and
2,by this point your committee is senior
2,or should have seen your presentation
2,not the specific one you'll give on your
2,defense but over time they should have
2,seen multiple times kind of what it is
2,that you've been working on so they
2,already have a good idea and
2,they're going to afterwards ask
2,questions and the questions can be
2,general science related so I've seen
2,people that have reached back and asked
2,questions about what you studied in
2,biochem the first year but for the most
2,part the questions are going to be more
2,focused about what is it that happened
2,in your research what did you learn what
2,areas could you improve on if you were
2,to go back and do it again what would
2,you do differently and so this is kind
2,of what the focus is how it differs from
2,a master's student really the biggest
2,difference is the preliminary exams so
2,you don't have to take preliminary exams
2,as a master's student you typically
2,don't have to take as many of the
2,advanced courses you usually just take
2,more of the general courses that
2,everybody takes and the amount of
2,research you need in your dissertation
2,is much less so I would say typically a
2,master's student will take about three
2,years to finish and a PhD student will
2,take about five to six years and this
2,varies so my PhD lasted just around
2,three years so I was very fast but not
2,everybody will go that fast and that's
2,fine you could take three years you
2,could take six years one isn't more how
2,fast you finish your PhD is not
2,indicative of how successful you're
2,going to be and that's an important
2,thing to keep in mind
2,so what else encompasses a PhD because
2,that seems pretty straightforward right
2,you take your classes you do your
2,prelims and you do some research and
2,write your dissertation
2,so what else encompasses a PhD okay so
2,what else is involved is learning
2,experimental techniques so some of you
2,will have done research and your
2,undergrad but in a PhD you have to have
2,a whole new level of understanding of
2,how experiments work and you're gonna
2,have to learn many new experiments this
2,is going to be the majority of your time
2,is learning experiments and executing
2,those experiments other things that I
2,strongly suggest if your department does
2,not require it which most likely they
2,will you really need to publish your
2,work publishing your work is key the
2,easiest way to get your committee to
2,agree to let you defend is to say I've
2,already published my work it's been
2,published it's been through the
2,peer-review process and we're gonna have
2,a whole video dedicated to publishing
2,your work the other thing is that it is
2,paramount to finding a postdoc position
2,if you don't have a publication you will
2,not find a postdoc position and if you
2,don't have multiple publications it will
2,be hard to find a good postdoc position
2,so it's very very important to publish
2,this is maybe the most important thing
2,you will do in graduate school is to
2,publish first author work other things
2,that you can do that will help you in
2,terms of facilitating your graduation
2,and in finding a good postdoc position
2,they are applying for grants your PI
2,will help you and I will make a whole
2,video about applying for grants helping
2,your PI with peer review or helping your
2,PI write a review article if your PR is
2,going to be writing a review article ask
2,hey can I help co-author this
2,or you're reviewing a paper or the next
2,time you review a paper can I help these
2,are things that you could put on your CV
2,and we will have a video dedicated to
2,building your CV because this is an
2,important part of not just graduating
2,but finding that post our position and
2,then having a built a CV built up enough
2,that when you finish your postdoc it
2,looks sufficient to finding a faculty
2,position so all of this really goes into
2,the experience of graduate school I know
2,I threw a lot out there but each of
2,these are gonna become their own
2,separate videos but I just wanted to put
2,out a video explaining sort of an
2,overview of what graduate school will be
2,like so with that I want to thank you
2,please like the video subscribe and I'll
2,see you in the next one thanks
3,hi everybody welcome back to my channel
3,make sure to subscribe and hit the like
3,button so today what we're gonna be
3,doing is covering how to apply for a
3,postdoc position maybe your more senior
3,and you're about to apply for a postdoc
3,position or maybe you're more junior and
3,you're thinking about what do I need in
3,order to be successful in the future
3,when I do apply for a postdoc position
3,in either case I think that you're going
3,to find this video to be helpful or at
3,least I hope so
3,uh-huh so what is the process and what
3,should you do and so forth so I think
3,the first thing that anyone that is
3,ready to be applying for a postdoc
3,position should do is that they should
3,update their CV this is the most
3,important thing you're gonna be needing
3,to send your CV out and this is also
3,gonna help you in some other ways so
3,what are some things that are important
3,to have on your CV so of course your
3,education I would definitely include any
3,papers that you've published or that are
3,impressed or that are in preparation
3,what you need to do is you need to
3,demonstrate to your future p.i that
3,you're applying to join their lab that
3,you have some level of productivity and
3,the easiest way to judge that is how
3,much you've published the next thing you
3,need to do is add in presentations that
3,you've given highlight any awards that
3,you've won highlight any grants that
3,you've received you need to highlight
3,anything that you could think of even
3,experimental techniques sometimes P eyes
3,like to hire people that are in slightly
3,different fields because they have an
3,area of expertise that is not the same
3,as their lab so as an example I work in
3,a lab that deals with brown adipose
3,tissue and energy metabolism that's the
3,research that I do we recently hired a
3,new postdoc that specializes in
3,medicinal chemistry he basically does
3,analytical chemistry
3,specifically with lipids but we don't
3,have anyone in the lab that can do that
3,and it's very important for some of the
3,research areas that our lab is
3,endeavoring right now so highlighting
3,your techniques that you specialize in
3,it helps to market yourself
3,and I strongly suggest having your PI
3,and other committee members read over
3,your CV and ask for feedback
3,constructive feedback really ask what
3,can I do to make my CV more appealing
3,now when you apply for a postdoc your CV
3,is obviously not going to be as long as
3,your PI's and it's gonna look a little
3,different and that's fine what you need
3,to do is highlight your skills so
3,experimental and your productivity what
3,have you done in graduate school now
3,this is important for another reason and
3,the second reason is it's going to help
3,you assess where you should be applying
3,for a postdoc so this is something that
3,you and your ki I should definitely
3,discuss where is it appropriate for you
3,to be looking if you haven't published
3,anything you've done one seminar and an
3,obscure conference and you don't have a
3,lot else to put on your CV applying for
3,a position at Harvard is just not
3,realistic and it's not worth wasting
3,your time
3,the pis at Harvard get hundreds of
3,applications for postdocs so if you're
3,gonna spend time applying there you
3,should at least have a realistic chance
3,of getting a position there so after
3,you've completed your CV you should sit
3,down with your PA and you should discuss
3,where is it appropriate to apply for a
3,postdoc and what I mean by where is it
3,appropriate that takes into account two
3,things the first thing is the Institute
3,the second thing is the field so the
3,Institute is going to be sort of
3,determined by how your CV looks in the
3,lab that you're coming from so if you're
3,coming from a well-respected lab you can
3,lack a little bit in the CV if you're
3,coming from a less known lab you have to
3,have an even more stellar CV and you
3,need to assess the field so do you want
3,to stay in a field that's the exact same
3,so if you're in cancer biology and
3,you're currently studying breast cancer
3,do you want to stay in breast cancer do
3,you even want to stay in cancer do you
3,want to move to metabolite
3,so a good example is when I did my PhD I
3,was in an aging lab but I did aging
3,research that was related to metabolism
3,and I decided that I didn't quite want
3,to continue in aging because I felt I
3,already had an OK background what I
3,wanted to do was get a better feel for
3,metabolism so I switched to a metabolism
3,lab and that's totally fine people
3,switch fields sometimes people switch
3,fields completely so you need to kind of
3,decide where you want to go and when
3,you're doing this you need to keep a
3,couple of things in mind the work that
3,you do as a grad student is very
3,important and it really sets you up for
3,understanding how to do research but the
3,work that you do is a post document
3,that's the work that you're gonna take
3,with you if you go into academics so
3,knowing what field you're in is very
3,important the other thing is the PI they
3,are going to you want to go to a lab
3,that has a well-respected PI and we're
3,gonna get into that in a minute
3,so you've updated your CV and you've sat
3,down with your PI and said this is kind
3,of the area of research that I want to
3,go in and this is kind of the type of
3,Institute that I'm looking at and you
3,might need to keep in mind a couple
3,different institutes in that area so are
3,you gonna go to a tier one school like a
3,Harvard or Stanford a tier 2 school like
3,a University of Michigan or tiers three
3,school so these are things to keep in
3,mind once you've done that you need to
3,pick appropriate mentors so what do I
3,look for or what should you look for
3,when you're applying for a postdoc well
3,the first thing is how many postdocs are
3,in that lab um so there are labs that
3,have no postdocs one postdoc there's
3,some that are mid-sized that have five
3,or six and then there are some that have
3,more than ten postdocs this is important
3,for a few reasons the first reason is
3,how much attention can your PI give you
3,if you're somebody that's going to need
3,a lot of hand-holding or a lot of
3,attention
3,you don't want to go to a lab with 10
3,postdocs in it because quite frankly
3,you're not going to get that level of
3,attention it's just the PI only has so
3,many hours in a day and they have other
3,postdocs and other commitments that they
3,have to worry about so my lab I have
3,seven postdocs all together in this lab
3,I'm one of seven and I get to meet with
3,my PI infrequently sometimes but really
3,I get one hour a week to meet with her
3,that's about it now I'm okay with that
3,but not everybody is okay with that so
3,that's something to keep in mind another
3,thing to keep in mind is of the postdocs
3,that they have and again this is gonna
3,vary if they have one or two or if they
3,have ten the post-sex that they've had
3,how successful have they been do they
3,publish and high-impact journals do they
3,secure grants do they find faculty
3,positions or positions in industry or at
3,NIH you know wherever you want to go if
3,you want to go to industry and your goal
3,is to go to industry but you apply to
3,person access lab because they publish
3,your papers and they all get academic
3,positions well that may not be the best
3,fit because that he I doesn't have
3,experience getting her postdocs or his
3,postdocs into industry so you need to
3,find a postdoc that has a proven track
3,record for what your specific goals are
3,so my specific goal is to eventually
3,have my own lab so when I applied for
3,postdocs
3,I looked at P is that had postdocs that
3,successfully published in high-impact
3,papers and I'm sorry in high-impact
3,journals P is that had post X that
3,successfully secured F and K level
3,funding and postdocs that successfully
3,transitioned into independent faculty
3,members because that's what my goal is
3,if they haven't done that with others
3,there's no guarantee they'll be able to
3,do it with you
3,so that's something to keep in mind so
3,you have gone and you have updated your
3,CV you've discussed with your PI what
3,field you want to go and and kind of
3,what institute you want to go to and you
3,guys have come to a consensus and now
3,you've narrowed down a list of some
3,posts our positions that you would like
3,to apply for how do you go about apply
3,there's two ways the first way is to
3,look at job sites so if you go to
3,indeed.com or any of these other job
3,sites you might see some postdoc
3,positions offered there or to go to
3,school or department websites that may
3,be advertising that Professor Y or
3,professor a B is looking for a postdoc
3,position and these are the
3,qualifications that we're looking for
3,the second way which is the way that I
3,took and I think a lot of people take is
3,to inquire that is to say I am
3,interested in joining this person's lap
3,they don't have anything necessarily
3,listed but I'm going to send them an
3,email and say you know my name is
3,whatever and I'm interested in joining
3,your lab this is the way that I went and
3,I think a lot of people do go so when
3,you go to send these emails what should
3,you say so the first thing you need to
3,do is introduce yourself say you know my
3,name is Justin and I'm interested in
3,joining your lab you need to give some
3,background about yourself
3,so I come from University acts and
3,blanks laboratory and this is sort of
3,what I studied and then the most
3,important thing is you need to tie it
3,back to their lab they're going to get
3,so many people emailing them saying I
3,want to join your lab and what it looks
3,like is it's just a general spam email
3,that you sent to 50 different people you
3,need to tailor it to each person so
3,my name is John Doe and I studied breast
3,cancer at UCLA and in dr. J DS lab my
3,research was in metastasis I'm
3,interested in joining your lab because
3,you do blank work with metastasis and I
3,find it really interesting it can be as
3,simple as that but what you need to do
3,is let them know that you've at least
3,read some of the papers from their lab
3,and that you have a general idea of what
3,it is that their lab does that goes such
3,a long way I cannot stress that enough
3,if you don't do that they are very
3,likely to just throw out the email that
3,you sent you really really need to
3,stress to them this is what it is that
3,you're interested in their specific lab
3,you also need to include your CV and I
3,would find it useful to also include
3,three professional references so one is
3,going to have to be your PI and then two
3,more typically people that are on your
3,committee or your grad school advisor or
3,your department chair but people that
3,are familiar with you and your research
3,would be the best choices and so then
3,you need to send out to multiple people
3,and then you have to wait and what
3,you're gonna find is you're gonna get
3,different responses you're gonna get
3,some that are gonna say I just don't
3,have funding right now I'm sorry and
3,that's fine funding is very hard and so
3,I myself applied and one lab told me
3,that they didn't quite have funding so
3,they they weren't sure whether they can
3,fund me for the whole amount of time
3,that I wanted to be in their lab some
3,will say that they're interested and
3,that they want to interview you and some
3,may just say no or may not get back to
3,you and again that's also fine not
3,everybody is going to be accepted to
3,every lab they apply to even if you're a
3,stellar candidate for whatever reason
3,the P I may not need another postdoc you
3,may not be able to afford another
3,postdoc you may not even have space for
3,another post
3,so just keep that in mind and don't take
3,it personally that's why you're gonna
3,apply to more than one so I would say at
3,least a minimum of five places is where
3,you should apply at least five now the
3,other thing to keep in mind is that this
3,is our process so once you send out an
3,email by the time you finally get
3,someone that says okay I'm willing to
3,take you for an interview you go for an
3,interview they give you a position or
3,offer you a position and you start a
3,laugh it's going to take time so don't
3,expect to start applying for postdoc
3,positions and then within a month you
3,have a job it's not gonna go that fast
3,so give it at least three four five even
3,six months time so also consider that
3,when you're planning your defense that
3,it's going to take time then the last
3,part of course then is the interview and
3,so what is the interview typically
3,consist of so the interview is going to
3,consist of giving a presentation to the
3,lab either over Skype or in person
3,sometimes the whole department is
3,invited and then getting to meet with
3,the postdocs and that are in the lab and
3,getting to meet with the PI that are in
3,the lab now this is a very important
3,thing there are questions that you
3,undoubtedly should ask the postdocs in
3,the lab and the PI and there are so many
3,people I know that are unhappy with the
3,labs that they joined because they did
3,not ask these questions and they wish
3,that they did I was fortunate enough to
3,have someone give me advice before I
3,went for my interviews so I knew to ask
3,these questions so what should you ask
3,of the postdocs first let's start there
3,so the first thing you should obviously
3,ask is what do you think of life in the
3,lab and believe me the postdocs will be
3,very honest with you I don't think many
3,postdocs that hate life in the lab are
3,gonna tell you that it's fantastic
3,they'll at least give signs that they're
3,unhappy so kind of look for subtleties
3,and what they say but for the most part
3,I think they'll be straightforward ask
3,what is life like in the lab you know
3,how many hours a day are you working are
3,you often working weekends are you often
3,working late at night
3,what tends to be the expectations of the
3,postdocs in the lab you know are you
3,expected to publish a nature paper in
3,the first couple years these are
3,important things to ask the postdocs how
3,does everyone in the lab get a log
3,that's an important one a lot of times
3,the PI doesn't know how everybody in the
3,lab gets along and you want to go
3,somewhere that everyone seems to get
3,along because the last thing you need
3,when you're struggling to get through a
3,postdoc because they have other post-sex
3,in the lab that don't get along they
3,argue it just is not a good experience
3,ask them how do you think of your PI
3,compared to other PI's at the Institute
3,I love my PI and every postdoc in the
3,lab is gonna tell you that RPI is one of
3,our favorite professors in the Institute
3,if they don't say that that's not a good
3,sign if they say well you know mikey is
3,good but I I'd rather go to X or wise
3,lab instead I would have gone to there
3,like that that's not a good sign you
3,don't want to go to that lab and then
3,what are things that you need to ask the
3,PI how long are you able to fund me for
3,what are your expectations of postdocs
3,again what are their expectations do
3,they want you to publish a nature paper
3,in the first year or is it that they
3,want you to publish a paper within the
3,first three years you know be realistic
3,about what the expectations are what are
3,your expectations for me securing
3,funding so some labs you don't need to
3,get your own funding and in other labs
3,you have about a year to get funding or
3,they're gonna ask you to leave so what
3,are the expectations for funding
3,do you compete with postdocs when they
3,leave this is a important point you
3,don't want a pie
3,that's going to tell you when you leave
3,that you can't take any of the work that
3,you did you can't take any of the
3,reagents you can't take any of the ideas
3,that it belongs to the lab that's not
3,good
3,you want a pie that's going to say when
3,you graduate or not when you graduate
3,when you're done with your postdoc that
3,you can take your ideas and reagents
3,with you and I'm not going to compete in
3,that area with you and that is so
3,crucial so make sure you find out about
3,that beforehand ask what is the success
3,rate with your postdocs in finding the
3,position that they want how can you help
3,me if I have trouble with X or Y ask
3,these questions I'll be honest with you
3,and it's gonna go a long way into
3,ensuring that you really are in the best
3,position for you and what I want to
3,stress by that everybody wants to go to
3,Harvard or Stanford etc further postdoc
3,but that's not going to be the best
3,position for everybody example at
3,Harvard most people have to have their
3,own funding but if you're not quite
3,ready enough yet to secure your own
3,funding it's not gonna be a successful
3,time for you some people need to have
3,someone that could teach them
3,experiments because they are a little
3,slower learning experimental techniques
3,and that's fine but if you're in a big
3,lab with a lot of postdocs the PIA is
3,not gonna have time to teach you
3,techniques you're gonna have to learn on
3,your own or rely on other postdocs so
3,knowing what your needs are you need to
3,ask specific questions to the PI that
3,you're thinking about joining their lab
3,to make sure that you get the most out
3,of the lab that you go to
3,and that's about it for this video I
3,hope that this helps this is a very
3,individual topic everyone has their own
3,needs and wants in a lab I wanted to go
3,to a top Institute in the top lab that
3,publishes top papers I know a lot of
3,people do but there's also a lot of
3,people that would like to go there but
3,don't quite have not the skill set but
3,there's different things that are not
3,readily apparent to them so there are
3,people that don't do well in big labs
3,they really they thrive in a smaller lab
3,environment going to Harvard you won't
3,find a small lab environment and you
3,might be more successful in a different
3,Institute with a smaller lab and there
3,are other Institute's than Harvard
3,that's a very important thing to stress
3,just because you don't go to Harvard or
3,Stanford or UCLA is not the end of the
3,world you could be successful postdoc at
3,many Institute's and I will stress that
3,the lab that you come from is just as
3,important as the Institute itself you
3,need to look for a PI as well it's
3,better to go to a big-name person in a
3,tier 2 school then to go to a Tier one
3,school with a brand new P I that just
3,got their first ro one so keep that in
3,mind but overall I hope that this helps
3,clear up some of the stuff that you're
3,gonna need to accomplish so just to
3,recap the first thing you need to do is
3,get your CV in order the second step is
3,you need to talk to your PI and kind of
3,come to a consensus about what's
3,appropriate to you you need to send out
3,applications have good interviews and
3,and hopefully your pie will be able to
3,help you to prepare for these interviews
3,and practice your presentations and then
3,you need to ask the right questions of
3,both the postdocs in the lab and the PI
3,whose lab you're thinking about joining
3,and again I really can't stress this
3,enough you need to think about what is
3,best for you every person that's
3,applying for a postdoc is different but
3,I promise you there are so many postdocs
3,out there there are postdocs available
3,for everybody
3,there are even postdocs and Industry NIH
3,there's all kinds of opportunities out
3,there you really need to think about
3,what is best for you so with that thank
3,you again for watching the video don't
3,forget to Like subscribe and I'll catch
3,you in the next one bye
4,hi everybody welcome back to my channel
4,before you continue watching please make
4,sure you hit the like button and
4,subscribe today we're gonna talk about
4,slumps in grad school and I think this
4,is a very common problem that goes
4,untalked about so when you look at a
4,written dissertation or a senior grad
4,student or postdoc present their
4,research you tend to think that their
4,research was a straight line they had a
4,hypothesis based on previously published
4,work they tested it experimentally then
4,they got the result and they discuss how
4,it fits into the broader picture that's
4,not really the way research works the
4,way research works is a lot of zigs zags
4,circles changing directions trying to
4,come up with new hypotheses on the fly
4,that's that's the truth of the matter
4,we're very good at making our research
4,look linear but it really is hardly ever
4,linear like that and so because of that
4,what you're going to have is a lot of
4,grad students that are going to come
4,into grad school that were probably
4,straight-a students or at the very least
4,a mix of a B grades so they did well
4,they probably did well and a lot of
4,things that they've done in life and
4,they're not used to failure and the one
4,thing you have to learn about grad
4,school and that's particularly doing
4,research is failure is something that is
4,going to happen I remember my department
4,chair when I was a grad student said
4,that only 9 percent of scientific
4,experiments work and for a grad student
4,that's in their first year it's probably
4,only a fraction of that that it's
4,probably true when you do research
4,you're going to fail over and over and
4,over again you're going to do
4,experiments that give no results you're
4,gonna do experiments that give
4,contradictory results you're gonna spin
4,in circles and you have to get used to
4,this you have to get over it the people
4,that finish grad school are not always
4,the smartest but what they are are the
4,people that can persevere you have to
4,persevere
4,when I was in my first year of grad
4,school I really wanted to drop out I
4,actually had a real conversation with my
4,parents that grad school is not for me
4,and that I want to drop out and this is
4,what I want to do instead and I think a
4,lot of people have this kind of thought
4,at least that maybe grad school is not
4,for me maybe I made a mistake coming
4,here
4,maybe it's not worth it but I promise
4,you that it is and I promise you that
4,you're not alone and feeling like this
4,you're definitely not alone and feeling
4,like this the overwhelming amount of
4,grad students will at some point feel
4,like I made a mistake or what in the
4,world am I doing here
4,this is just it's not worth it but I
4,promise you that it will be and if you
4,keep her severe and you can get through
4,it so the things that you can do to get
4,through it one is assess the situation
4,is the problem the lab or is it
4,something that's going on with you for
4,me when I was in my first year I
4,definitely thought it was me but then as
4,I looked at it I realized I was in a
4,really toxic lab environment the pee I
4,was not good the senior grad student was
4,toxic there was a lot of yelling telling
4,people that they're stupid that they
4,don't deserve to be here things like
4,this and it wasn't a good environment
4,and so because of that I changed to a
4,new lab and as a grad student or postdoc
4,it's okay to change labs it's not
4,uncommon it's something that does happen
4,but make sure that if you change that it
4,really is because you need a change of
4,setting if it's well I can't do a
4,Western blot so I'm hoping if I change
4,labs and go to another lab I'll be able
4,to do a Western blot that's probably not
4,gonna happen but if there is a toxic
4,environment think about changing labs
4,but if that isn't the case which
4,probably it isn't then these are the
4,things I want you to keep in mind first
4,of all I'm not sure where this thought
4,came from I'm not even sure that it's
4,"real but they say that it takes 10,000"
4,hours of practicing something before you
4,can truly master it and whether it's
4,"10,000 hours or 8,000 or whatever the"
4,number is that's true of science - no
4,one's going to walk into a lab and be
4,perfect at experiments even the best
4,scientists
4,practice so continue practicing keep
4,doing work you will get better at doing
4,experiments you will get better at
4,troubleshooting your experiments and
4,figuring out where you went wrong you
4,will get better at designing experiments
4,it will come you just have to keep
4,practicing my second piece of advice is
4,to not only rely on your pee I talked to
4,other grad students and postdocs you'd
4,be surprised how willing they probably
4,will be in helping you and they're the
4,ones that are currently doing research a
4,lot of PI's haven't sat at the bench for
4,quite some time and they don't know
4,everything that's going on and they
4,can't always remember clearly what it
4,was like when they were a grad student
4,or what they were doing as a postdoc so
4,talk to people that are currently at the
4,bench they're your best option by far
4,and with that set paid forward when you
4,are senior grad student and someone
4,comes to make sure you're willing to
4,help them remember what it was like when
4,you were in junior grad student and
4,that's probably the best advice I could
4,give you this is gonna be a rather short
4,video but really the point of putting
4,this out is to let people know that
4,you're not alone that other people feel
4,depressed feel that they're questioning
4,themselves on whether they really should
4,be in grad school or whether they want
4,to continue and there are people that
4,drop out every year there's someone from
4,every department that drops out it seems
4,but you don't have to be that person you
4,can keep working and you can do
4,excellent work just keep trying that's
4,the best advice that I can give you just
4,keep trying so with that I want to say
4,thanks for watching make sure to hit
4,that like button and subscribe and I'll
4,see you guys in the next one
5,hi everybody welcome back to my channel
5,before we continue make sure to
5,subscribe and hit the like button it'll
5,really go a long way to grow the channel
5,so today we're gonna be talking about
5,applying to graduate school this is a
5,pretty standard thing across different
5,schools and departments some variations
5,in there but I kind of want to talk
5,about the things that you're gonna have
5,to do and things that I wish that I knew
5,what I applied so there's four things
5,that you're gonna have to really make
5,sure that you get done when you apply to
5,graduate school you need to get your
5,transcripts with your grades you need to
5,take the GRE and sometimes the subject
5,matter GRE you need to write a personal
5,statement and you need to get letters of
5,recommendation and we're gonna talk
5,about all four of those today and then
5,we're gonna go into some common myths
5,about applying to graduate school and
5,what they actually look for so the first
5,one is obvious is your transcript don't
5,think there's a whole lot to say about
5,this you need to get your transcript and
5,send it over to them and show them what
5,classes you took and what your GPA is so
5,we won't really go too much into that
5,well we'll do is talk more about the GRE
5,so there's a general GRE that everybody
5,takes and then there's subject matter G
5,Aires so the way the GRE works is
5,there's a verbal and a logic reasoning
5,section essentially so you're gonna have
5,an English section and a math section
5,and the way this works is everyone
5,applying to graduate school whether
5,you're applying for a biology department
5,a math or engineering department at
5,English departments that ecology
5,department everyone takes the same GRE
5,and then all the scores from that GRE
5,are weighted against each other so for
5,example if you score an 80% on the GRE
5,and math that means out of everyone in
5,all the different departments and all
5,the different areas of study that are
5,taking the GRE you are in the 80th
5,percentile of everybody likewise if
5,you're in the 20th percentile for
5,English that means out of everybody
5,applying you're in the 20th percentile
5,and so why does it matter to keep in
5,mind these percentiles and to keep in
5,mind that everybody takes this
5,so if you're watching this video most
5,likely you're gonna be applying for a
5,basic biology department and if that's
5,the case when you take for example math
5,you're competing against engineers and
5,people that have studied math and so
5,it's very hard to score in the top
5,couple percentile because they've just
5,taken more math than you have in a study
5,math more than you by the time that I
5,took the GRE I had not taken a math
5,class in several years already
5,likewise though if you are an engineer
5,it is very important to score well on
5,the math section because you should have
5,more math than most people taking the
5,GRE so that's something to keep in mind
5,another thing that is out there are
5,what's called subject matter GREs and
5,those are GREs that specialize in a
5,specific area now it's very important
5,when you apply for a program to take a
5,look at what their basic requirements
5,are usually they'll have requirements
5,for what they're looking for is a GPA
5,what they're looking for is percentiles
5,or scores for the GRE and the list if
5,they would like you to take a subject
5,matter GRE the departments that I apply
5,to do not require a subject matter GRE
5,and so I didn't take one but if yours
5,does you're going to need to prepare for
5,that now the best way to prepare for the
5,GRE is either with a book or in a class
5,either way is acceptable and I've seen
5,both ways been executed with good scores
5,I think that either way that you do it
5,works and I think that a lot of times it
5,comes down more to the person taking the
5,GRE than the necessarily the way that
5,they study for the GRE but we can also
5,make a video in the future about
5,preparing for the GRE now the last two
5,things that you're going to need are a
5,personal statement and a letter of
5,recommendation and you're gonna need
5,multiple letters of recommendation and I
5,think for the letters of recommendation
5,this is pretty self-explanatory we need
5,to go to faculty members that know you
5,well so not your parents not a relative
5,or friend we need to go to faculty
5,members
5,either had you in a class or that you
5,performed research with or that you know
5,in some other way and they need to write
5,a letter of recommendation for you about
5,why you would be a good fit for graduate
5,school program now you're you typically
5,gonna need three letters of
5,recommendation so you need to start
5,thinking ahead of time who you should
5,talk to now for some of you this might
5,be the first time that you're getting a
5,letter of recommendation it's important
5,to know how this works when getting a
5,letter of recommendation what you need
5,to do is go to that faculty member and
5,tell them I'm applying for graduate
5,school in these different departments
5,and this is what they require and I
5,would like for you to write a letter of
5,recommendation for me now typically
5,they'll say okay as long as you're on a
5,friendly basis but they're gonna ask for
5,some things they might ask for your CV
5,so send me your CV tell me what your
5,grades are tell me what your goals are
5,why do you want to go to graduate school
5,they want to be able to personalize
5,their letter recommendation for you and
5,that's a very good thing
5,personalization is key and that's gonna
5,carry over into your personal statement
5,when you write a personal statement a
5,lot of what you write is going to be
5,similar from one graduate department to
5,another what you need to do is also kind
5,of tailor it a little bit to each
5,department and say I would like to go to
5,Department X because I think I would fit
5,in well there and the courses that you
5,guys teach are interesting or I would
5,like to go to Department Z and I want to
5,go there because I think the faculty
5,members are outstanding you need to kind
5,of tailor it to each department a little
5,bit so these are the core things that
5,you need to apply for graduate school
5,now what are some of the common myths
5,about graduate school I think the number
5,one myth that gets perpetuated is you
5,need to be a straight-a student to get
5,into graduate school that is absolutely
5,not true at all
5,when you apply for graduate school the
5,department is gonna list what their
5,requirements are so we are looking for
5,students that have a 3.5 GPA that score
5,and the 70th percent
5,or higher on the GRE we need to send in
5,a personal statement and you need to
5,give us email addresses for three people
5,that we could ask for letters of
5,recommendation for example that 3.5 GPA
5,that I mentioned before is basically a
5,way of weeding out applications so if
5,they get a hundred applications what
5,they could do is they could say okay of
5,these 100 applications 50 of them didn't
5,meet that minimum GPA so we're gonna
5,toss them out the window now is it
5,possible to get into a program if you
5,don't meet that minimum GPA yes I know
5,people that have gotten into programs
5,even though they had just below that
5,minimum GPA so it doesn't necessarily
5,hurt to apply but I would keep in mind
5,that a lot of times the minimum GPA is
5,used only as a weed out and so if you
5,don't hit that minimum requirement
5,there's a good chance they're gonna just
5,get rid of your application upfront so
5,you don't need to be a straight-a
5,student what you need is to hit that
5,minimum cutoff and the same kind of myth
5,applies to the GRE that you need to
5,score in the top 10 percent for them to
5,accept you actually that's really not
5,true usually the GRE scores as same as
5,the GPA are just used as a way to weed
5,out students so this is a way to say
5,okay students a B and C hit R minimum
5,and the rest did it so we'll just weed
5,out the rest of them so that's kind of
5,the way that we doubts work with the GPA
5,in GRE and so that leads us into what
5,are actually the most important things
5,when you apply to graduate school
5,because another myth is that the GPA and
5,grades are the most important thing when
5,you apply to graduate school and if
5,you're applying to medical school your
5,GPA and MCAT
5,important but in graduate school it's
5,more of a way to just weed people out I
5,would actually argue and I've talked to
5,some people that are on up the
5,committee's that essentially select the
5,students that will come in and they've
5,said to me the number one thing that
5,they actually look at is your personal
5,statement so after they've weeded people
5,out based on GPA and GRE the first thing
5,they're gonna look at is your personal
5,statement what do you have to say about
5,yourself why are you interested in
5,research why are you interested in this
5,department what are your career goals
5,where do you see yourself in ten years
5,how will go into this graduate school
5,department help you to achieve your goal
5,the second most important thing that
5,they will look at are your letters of
5,recommendation so people that are PhDs
5,themselves and have been working in an
5,academic Institute or maybe an industry
5,wherever you might get these letter of
5,recommendations what do they think about
5,you do they think that you have what it
5,takes to go through graduate school this
5,is a very important thing once you've
5,gone through graduate school you kind of
5,know what it takes to make it through
5,and you have an idea of what person may
5,or may not be able to survive the
5,grueling nature of graduate school and
5,so they want to know what their opinion
5,is do you think this is someone that
5,really would be a good fit or not and
5,believe it or not when people write
5,letters of recommendation they are
5,brutally honest so if you don't think
5,that a professor is going to write you a
5,good letter recommendation don't do it
5,they can write a general letter
5,recommendation and not say anything
5,great about you but it'll stick out like
5,a sore thumb because people that really
5,know the people that they're writing a
5,letter of recommendation for will
5,personalize it and will really emphasize
5,just how special that person is so if
5,this is someone you don't know well or
5,they don't necessarily like you that
5,much don't even bother asking them to
5,a letter recommendation okay so those
5,are some of the common myths what else
5,do you need to know about applying for
5,graduate school I think one piece of
5,information that you need to know is
5,that it's very hard to get in so in the
5,year that I got into graduate school
5,there was over 200 people that applied
5,and they only accepted six people so if
5,you do the math it's a little under
5,three percent acceptance rate and this
5,is pretty standard
5,I think medical school acceptance rates
5,are more about 7% in graduate school
5,rates are even lower so it's very
5,difficult to get in so because of that I
5,would definitely try to apply for more
5,than one school definitely pick a range
5,of schools and a range of departments
5,you grana vary it up so some you maybe
5,want to apply in a medical school others
5,you want to apply in a basic biology
5,department but I think varying what you
5,apply to is really going to help your
5,chances of getting in now two other
5,pieces of information that I want to
5,share one is another myth and that is
5,that you have to be at an excellent
5,University in order to be in a graduate
5,school this is the same thing as having
5,a great great GPA yes it will help
5,coming from a good University or having
5,a good GPA when it isn't a determining
5,founder so even if you're coming from a
5,smaller school don't feel discouraged or
5,feel like there's no chance for you to
5,get in that's not really true
5,so still give it your best shot another
5,piece of advice that I want to give is
5,contacting Department members this is
5,something I really really wish that I
5,knew when I first apply to graduate
5,school when you go to graduate school
5,it's not like an undergrad where you're
5,in a department in graduate school yes
5,you are part of a department and the
5,department will accept you but really
5,you work for one person and that is the
5,PI of the lab you are basically their
5,employee so what does that mean what
5,that means is that if you are thinking
5,of applying to the physiology department
5,at the University of Iowa it is totally
5,okay for you to go to the physiology
5,department at University of Iowa's
5,website pull up the faculty members that
5,are there look to see which ones you're
5,interested in working for send them an
5,email say hi my name is Steve and I'm
5,interested in joining your lab because I
5,think that what you do and this and this
5,is interesting do you have an open
5,position available for a graduate
5,student if you do would we be able to
5,talk on the phone or communicate by
5,email about a possibility of me joining
5,your lab here's my CV thank you and have
5,a nice day that's totally acceptable and
5,the reason that I wish I knew this ahead
5,of time is that while a lot of people
5,will just apply for graduate school
5,programs and you can get in that way
5,that's how I got into mind was just
5,applying to graduate school programs it
5,is easier to get in if you talk to a
5,faculty member and that faculty member
5,says yes I have an opening I would like
5,to have you as a graduate student in my
5,lab when you apply to the department I
5,will help to make sure that you get in
5,through you know whatever means so
5,contacting faculty members up front is
5,really really helpful I wish I knew that
5,and I probably would have been able to
5,get into some different departments had
5,I known this so with that I think that
5,we've kind of wrapped up this video we
5,talked about some of the things that
5,you're gonna need in order to apply to
5,graduate school and we talked about some
5,of the myths associated with graduate
5,school and I gave you a little trick
5,there at the end about how to
5,communicate with some faculty members to
5,try to boost your chance of getting into
5,graduate school I hope you enjoyed the
5,video make sure to LIKE and subscribe
5,and I'll see you guys in the next one
5,bye
6,hi everybody welcome back to the channel
6,make sure to LIKE and subscribe so we
6,can continue to grow this channel today
6,what we're going to be talking about is
6,how to grow your CV and graduate school
6,so that you can land the postdoc
6,position that you want so we're gonna
6,break this part up into different areas
6,based on what I think are the most
6,important so this won't cover things
6,necessarily like finishing your
6,dissertation and defending your
6,dissertation because those are things
6,that you're gonna have to do in order to
6,complete your degree these are the
6,extras the things that really will make
6,you stand out from other people that are
6,applying for postdocs
6,I think one common misconception is that
6,people think doing your PhD is the most
6,important thing and yes it is the most
6,important thing because without it you
6,can't do anything else
6,but at the same time when you apply for
6,a postdoc position don't forget that
6,everybody else that's applying for that
6,postdoc position also has a PhD you're
6,no different than everybody else so what
6,you need to do in graduate school and
6,then again in a postdoc is find ways to
6,separate yourself and make you stand out
6,from the pack so these are the things
6,kind of an order of importance in my
6,mind what you need to do in order to
6,make yourself stand out from everybody
6,else so the first thing that you need to
6,do far and above everything else is
6,publish publish publish publish you will
6,hear the term publish or perish or that
6,publishing papers is the academic
6,currency and these are a hundred percent
6,true productivity is almost completely
6,measured by what you publish especially
6,when you're younger and you don't
6,necessarily have to secure grant funding
6,if you go through a PhD and you didn't
6,publish anything there's a joke that I
6,heard it's something like if you've gone
6,through your PhD and you haven't
6,published anything did you really do a
6,PhD did you really do any research and I
6,think there's some truth to that the
6,best dissertation is a finished
6,dissertation and even greater
6,dissertation than that is one that's
6,been published so the first thing you
6,need to do is publish now for a lot of
6,you this won't be a big issue because a
6,lot of departments are gonna require you
6,to publish your work anyways
6,for those of you that don't require it
6,in your department you really need to
6,work with your PI on making sure that
6,you get something published at least one
6,paper if you don't have one paper
6,published when you're done with your
6,post graduate school it's going to be
6,hard to secure a post our position
6,that's just the truth
6,and publish early or really are the
6,better because if you don't publish
6,anything until you've finished graduate
6,school well then that means you're
6,trying to look for a postdoc without
6,anything published so the earlier you
6,could publish something the better know
6,a common question is how many
6,publications do I need to have so a lot
6,of departments their requirement for
6,graduation is that you have one paper
6,you have to have one paper published my
6,PhD advisor had his own requirement that
6,was you needed two papers published so
6,what do you really need I've seen people
6,that have landed postdoc positions at
6,the Mayo Clinic with one paper and I've
6,seen people that have landed positions
6,at Harvard with one paper so yes you can
6,land good positions with just one paper
6,however it becomes much more tricky and
6,there's a lot more work you have to do
6,to land those positions I would say to
6,really be competitive you need to have
6,two first author papers by the time you
6,finish graduate school that is gonna
6,make sure that you've established
6,yourself as someone that can be
6,productive and when I say first author
6,paper is what I'm referring to is
6,original research we'll talk about
6,reviews in a second but I'm talking
6,about original research now if you are
6,lucky enough that you could have three
6,papers that's even better
6,publishing three papers really makes you
6,stand out as someone that really went up
6,above and beyond as a PhD student and
6,will really make you seem like an
6,outstanding candidate but in a realistic
6,sense I think two is a reasonable thing
6,to ask for and what you should be aiming
6,for now that's for original research so
6,what else can you do as far as
6,publishing to make your
6,we stand out more so as I said another
6,thing you could do is review articles or
6,commentaries so commentaries are a
6,little harder because usually it's only
6,a one author maybe two authors on
6,commentaries but review articles are
6,definitely something you could get
6,involved with so at the bare minimum if
6,you're a PI is writing a review article
6,you should ask to be able to help with
6,that review article so that you can be
6,listed as a co-author that's at the
6,minimum what would be even better though
6,and what I think that everyone should
6,strive to do is for at least one review
6,article you should go to your PI and say
6,next time you're asked to write a review
6,article even if it's for a smaller
6,journal can you let me be the first
6,author and by doing so that gives you
6,the ability to say I've had to first
6,author papers on original research and
6,I've had one first author on a review
6,article and a lot of PI's would be okay
6,with this now they're not just gonna
6,give you first author on the review
6,article you're gonna have to do some
6,work for it but they'll help you work
6,through it and I think this is also a
6,beneficial thing for you when you go to
6,your postdoc a lot of pis are gonna
6,assume that you can do a lot of
6,different things including rewriting and
6,putting together a review article
6,putting together a review article is a
6,little different than putting together
6,an original research article it takes a
6,little different skill set and you have
6,to tweak it based on your audience and
6,kind of come up with a focus of what you
6,want to talk about you're not just
6,throwing random things into that review
6,article so I think this is beneficial
6,for you in the long term but I think it
6,also is gonna go a long way to building
6,your CV so now that you've done this you
6,have to first author articles it's
6,original research and you have one
6,review article that your first author on
6,what else can you do to build your CV
6,the next thing that you need to do is
6,you need to go to conferences once a
6,year you should be going to a conference
6,and presenting your work now during
6,their first year you may not go to a
6,conference because you don't have any
6,research to present and that's fine but
6,as you get to your second and third and
6,fourth year you should be going and
6,presenting posters if
6,possible try to secure an oral
6,presentation that looks even better but
6,at least show that you've been going to
6,conferences and you've been presenting
6,research because this is where you start
6,to learn how to network and we'll have a
6,whole video about networking at
6,conferences in a future date but I think
6,that's something important to keep in
6,mind but that's another thing that you
6,could add now the last two things that I
6,think that everyone should try to do
6,that will really make you stand out from
6,people so the first one is peer review
6,this is something that I see hardly any
6,graduate students do and it was
6,something that I did and I think that it
6,made a big difference so I'm sure
6,everyone here is familiar with peer
6,review especially if you're thinking
6,about publishing something and if you're
6,not familiar with what peer review is
6,just briefly what it is is when you
6,submit an article for publication it
6,gets sent to experts in that field and
6,they're the ones that review those
6,articles and they provide criticisms and
6,critiques and there's a back-and-forth
6,dialogue between the reviewers and the
6,authors and this is how publications
6,ultimately go through and become
6,accepted and then are published but what
6,I don't see a lot of grad students doing
6,is peer reviewing now when you're a
6,graduate student it's very hard for you
6,to be invited to review an article
6,because most likely you haven't
6,published anything so the editors at
6,journals don't know who you are there's
6,no way for them to invite you but
6,probably your PI has been invited or
6,will be invited to review different
6,articles certainly by the time you get
6,to a more senior postdoc position you're
6,already starting to be astir of you for
6,articles I get asked once every couple
6,weeks to review a different article now
6,there's two reasons that reviewing for
6,peer review as a graduate student is
6,going to help
6,the first is pertaining to this video
6,and that has to do with the fact that
6,there's very few graduate students that
6,do this so if you could put on your CV
6,that you've peer-reviewed research what
6,it does is separate you from the pack
6,and that's what the point of doing these
6,things are is you're trying to separate
6,yourself from the pack so the way that
6,you go about doing this is you go to
6,your PI and you ask him or her next time
6,you're asked a peer review an article
6,can I also Co peer review with it review
6,this article with you and most likely
6,they'll say yes and what they'll do is
6,when they get some articles sent to them
6,what they'll do is they'll email the
6,editor of the journal and they'll say hi
6,I would like so-and-so who's a graduate
6,student in my lab to peer review this
6,article with me is that right and
6,usually the editor will say that's fine
6,usually they they really don't have a
6,problem with that and so what will
6,happen that is in a lot of instances you
6,kind of do it together so the PI will
6,give you the article and they'll take
6,the article you both read through it
6,come up with what you think needs to be
6,changed in the article and then talk
6,about it and kind of come to a consensus
6,and this teaches you how to peer review
6,an article because this is actually a
6,skill that's very difficult to do how to
6,appropriately critique an article so it
6,depends on the scope of the paper where
6,it's being submitted to what our authors
6,didn't include or did include there's a
6,lot that goes into it so it's very
6,difficult to peer review a paper
6,correctly and it takes quite a bit of
6,practice well when you do this you can
6,add this to your CV peer reviewing
6,articles is definitely something you
6,could add to your CV and this definitely
6,will set you apart from everybody else
6,because I promise you out of the 100
6,applications that P eyes get to join
6,their lab there might be only a handful
6,of people that have peer reviewed a
6,paper so this will make you stand out
6,the second thing it does is it lets
6,editors know who you are and kind of
6,gets them to think they could send you
6,other papers and that's good because
6,then as you become a postdoc you start
6,to be asked sort
6,more papers and next thing you know you
6,have a list of ten different journals
6,that you've reviewed for that you
6,yourself have been asked to do and so as
6,you move to the next stage in your
6,career you've already built this network
6,of editors that are willing to send you
6,manuscripts now the last thing that you
6,should consider doing and this is
6,something that you really need to think
6,about because it's gonna take a lot of
6,work and there's no guarantee that you
6,get a result at the end and this is to
6,apply for NIH funding so at the NIH they
6,have something that's called a f31
6,what an f31 is is a fellowship
6,application for graduate students so
6,similar to an ro1 what you're gonna do
6,is you're gonna come up with a research
6,strategy you're going to gather some
6,preliminary data which you've already
6,been doing in the lab you're gonna put
6,it together with what your aims are
6,which again is similar to your proposal
6,that you're going to work on so a lot of
6,this work is already done you're gonna
6,put that together along with some
6,personal statements and other
6,attachments that you need for NIH
6,applications such as bio sketches and
6,facilities and other general attachments
6,and you're gonna submit to NIH and if
6,you get it essentially what its gonna do
6,is pay for your salary it's not really
6,gonna pay for any of the work you do
6,it'll give you some money for travel and
6,for some health insurance but that
6,really is on the back end you won't see
6,the money but this is a really crucial
6,thing there's no guarantee that you'll
6,get it but if you do get it it really
6,really really will set you apart from
6,everybody else and the reason that this
6,is important to do is because depending
6,on where you go you may be required to
6,secure funding so a lot of labs at
6,Harvard require that you carry your own
6,funding the PI will fund you for some
6,period of time but they really typically
6,don't want to pay your salary so by
6,being able to show that you can secure
6,funding you become a very attractive
6,candidate so in the ideal world what
6,you've done is you've published two
6,papers a review article you
6,some peer-review you've gone to
6,conferences to present and you've
6,secured a f31
6,the other option for funding is a t32
6,which are available to undergrads and
6,while those are good I think that the
6,f31 is something that will look even
6,better because it's not an institutional
6,grant now if you've done all of those
6,things and you've managed to do all of
6,them or even most of them you are pretty
6,set you are someone that is looking at
6,that point to get a very high-level
6,postdoc position it may not be your top
6,choice but you definitely will get
6,something good now other things that you
6,can do to improve your CV working with
6,other people in the lab so you get Co
6,authorships
6,that'll show that you could work as a
6,team and it's gonna add length to the
6,amount of publications that are on your
6,CV so make sure at any opportunity that
6,you can that you work with others so
6,that you can get co-authorship s-- apply
6,for different awards so this is
6,something I didn't realize until I was a
6,little bit ahead even at the level of Pi
6,a lot of awards that people win are ones
6,that they submit applications for
6,themselves or they ask somebody else can
6,you please submit for me don't think
6,that someone's going to submit an
6,application for you to win any sort of
6,award even your PI they probably won't
6,so you need to be proactive and either
6,ask somebody to and send them your CV
6,and you know what you're looking for or
6,you need to do it on your own behalf so
6,don't be afraid to do that like why
6,sometimes things that you can include on
6,your CV especially at early stages are
6,internal Awards so if there's a every
6,semester your department has
6,presentations for data and you win the
6,best presentation award or if you go to
6,a conference and you win an award for a
6,caps track anything like that are
6,definitely things that you want to
6,include on your CV the last piece of
6,advice I'll give you about building your
6,CV that applies for undergrads it
6,doesn't really apply for postdocs
6,anymore except if you're going to
6,industry and that's a different
6,but for undergrads this matters on your
6,CV you can list what are the different
6,techniques that you know in the lab so
6,if you've worked with animals before
6,what are the techniques that you know
6,about working with animals if you've
6,done molecular work on what molecular
6,work do you know these are things that
6,you could add on your CV that make a big
6,difference and it's important to list
6,everything even if it's something that
6,doesn't pertain to the lab that you're
6,going to and the reason for that is
6,while Appy I will like for you to have a
6,good foundation and understand a good
6,amount of the experiments that you're
6,gonna do in their lab you don't need to
6,know everything it's still training when
6,you're doing the postdoc and they
6,understand that and they're still
6,learning you'll do and you'll learn new
6,techniques but if you could demonstrate
6,that you know a technique that maybe
6,they're interested in and you may not
6,even know that they're interested in it
6,they may want to take you to their lab
6,because they want to integrate that
6,technique into their lab so for example
6,in our lab we have somebody that has
6,experience with mass spec and this is
6,something that our PI's wanted to
6,integrate into the lab is more knowledge
6,about lipid species in it and about mass
6,spec and so it was very attractive for
6,her to take in this particular postdoc
6,so these are things that I hope you
6,consider when you start trying to think
6,about how to build up your CV for
6,applying for postdoc in again you won't
6,get every single one of these maybe you
6,only have one paper or maybe you don't
6,get funding or maybe you you know
6,something else happens and you only go
6,to one conference you don't go to many
6,conferences that's fine not everyone's
6,gonna have a perfect CV and the point of
6,a CV is is something that can grow over
6,time organically so don't try to force
6,it but remember that you only have a few
6,years so if you're in a PhD for five
6,years total you know by the time you're
6,that fourth year what your CV looks like
6,is what its gonna be when you send out
6,application so the earlier you can start
6,doing these things the better so with
6,that I want to say thank you for

7,outside just for the fact that it's
7,sunny in Boston and that doesn't happen
7,very often just to remind everybody my
7,name is Justin I'm a postdoc at the
7,Joslin Diabetes Center in Harvard
7,Medical School and so the purpose of
7,this channel is to try to help people
7,that are entering grad school or that
7,are currently in grad school navigate
7,the waters and try to find a successful
7,postdoc position that's really what
7,we're trying to do here and I hope that
7,these videos do help in some way so
7,today what we're gonna be doing is
7,dispelling the myth that where you do
7,your PhD is important and I want to
7,start by saying that that's a really
7,strong statement to make of course where
7,your do your PhD does matter if you
7,could put on your CV that you did your
7,PhD at Stanford that does make a
7,difference and people will notice but
7,I'd make the argument that not just
7,where you do your PhD but who you do
7,your PhD with is even more important so
7,take two examples take the Stanford
7,example for exactly what if you were in
7,the lab of someone that's a new faculty
7,member at Stanford they've never had any
7,kind of graduate student before now
7,let's say that you go to a small
7,university like me I did my PhD at
7,Southern Illinois University
7,but the adviser that I had was a
7,world-renowned scientist he had many
7,postdocs and in his past many graduate
7,students he's won about every award that
7,you can under the Sun now I would make
7,the argument that doing your PhD in that
7,lab is much much more beneficial than
7,doing your PhD in a no-name lab at
7,Stanford and that's true for a few
7,reasons
7,so the first reason is that when you do
7,your PhD the person that's gonna have
7,the single most impact on who you are as
7,a scientist going forward is going to be
7,your thesis adviser and everybody knows
7,this so when you apply for a postdoc
7,position not only are they looking at
7,the Institute but they're looking to see
7,whose lab did you come from whose
7,training have you
7,it's always better to receive training
7,from the best than training from someone
7,with a no name that's the first thing to
7,keep in mind the second thing is that
7,when you have a thesis advisor that
7,really knows what they're doing and is
7,world renowned odds are at the end of it
7,you're going to have a bigger CV so what
7,does that mean and how is that important
7,so we'll take my example for a second
7,here as I said I did my PhD at Southern
7,Illinois University but I did my PhD in
7,the lab with a world-renowned scientist
7,and so what did that mean well when I
7,would apply for and sending in an
7,abstract for a conference for example
7,mine was more likely to be accepted for
7,an oral presentation because I was
7,coming from such a highly regarded lab
7,and that's important because it shows
7,that I had oral presentations I was able
7,to publish more papers etc etc you could
7,go down the list but you got to get the
7,point and so what happens is being in
7,these labs you start to build a CV
7,that's much stronger so when you apply
7,for a postdoc you're must much better
7,off and the other thing too that I want
7,to have you keep in mind is that when
7,you're doing this and we're going to go
7,into a whole video on picking a thesis
7,advisor so when you are starting grad
7,school how do you correctly identify and
7,pick a thesis advisor we'll go into that
7,in another video I kind of wanted to
7,keep this one short but I wanted to have
7,you keep in mind that when you have
7,these advisors just because you're in a
7,smaller university doesn't mean you
7,can't go to a bigger University for your
7,postdoc so we'll take Joslin Diabetes
7,Center for an example because that's
7,where I do my postdoc over at Harvard um
7,there are people that have gone to
7,fantastic universities so there's
7,someone in my lab for example that did
7,her PhD at Max Planck University at
7,Germany which is an excellent excellent
7,University but I would say more often
7,than not the people that are there are
7,like me they came from smaller
7,universities but they came from
7,fantastic labs so don't think that to be
7,able to do a postdoc at Harvard or
7,Stanford or any of these other schools
7,that you really had to have done your
7,PhD and a top
7,Tyr University that's not necessarily
7,TRUE
7,the lab that you come from is much more
7,important it really shapes who you are
7,as a scientist and it really determines
7,how your CV is going to look coming out
7,of grad school so I know that this video
7,was a little bit of rambling but we're
7,gonna do a whole video next on how to
7,correctly identify a thesis advisor and
7,I think that'll put into perspective the
7,things that you need to look for and
7,then you could take that and combine it
7,with this video and remember that
7,picking your thesis advisor is much more
7,important than where exactly you're
7,doing your PhD so with that I want to
7,say thank you to everybody for watching
7,the video and I'll catch you guys in the
7,next one bye
8,hi everybody so today I want to talk
8,about what actually makes a good PhD
8,student and there's several things that
8,you need in order to be a successful PhD
8,student and one thing I think stands out
8,more than others but it's not actually
8,what you think so there are things that
8,you need in order to be a successful PhD
8,student so things like intelligence the
8,ability to work hard to be able to seek
8,help those are all things that do play a
8,role but I think one thing that actually
8,stands out more than anything else is
8,perseverance the reason I say that is
8,because getting into a ph.d program
8,already sort of weeds out people based
8,on their natural ability or work ethic
8,most of the people that get into a ph.d
8,program really deserve to be there
8,there's very few that get in that
8,shouldn't be there and those people
8,quickly drop out but there's a saying
8,that you'll hear when you're in graduate
8,school which is the best dissertation is
8,a finished dissertation and that's true
8,to an extent persevering is going to be
8,the biggest challenge
8,most people that start a PhD are people
8,that are straight-a students or if not
8,straight-a students do pretty well in
8,school they've probably achieved at many
8,things throughout their life they've had
8,things come easy to them where they've
8,worked and been able to achieve it and
8,science being in the lab is a very
8,different beast than taking classes sure
8,when you're doing your PhD some of the
8,classes may be challenging but on the
8,whole I think that actually undergrad
8,classes tend to be a little harder than
8,grad school classes the majority of your
8,time in grad school is going to be in
8,the lab now this is where the issue
8,comes you're going to learn an
8,experiment so for example I'll use
8,western blotting as an example you're
8,gonna look at a protocol that says how
8,you should do a Western blot and you're
8,gonna see somebody do it you're gonna
8,say oh that's pretty straightforward you
8,know I do step ABC all the way down to Z
8,and then I get a result at the end and
8,what's going to be very frustrating very
8,quickly to everybody is you're gonna do
8,it and it's not gonna work or it'll work
8,okay on the first time when someone's
8,kind of they're walking you through it
8,but as soon as you're on your own it's
8,not gonna work
8,and you're gonna do it over and over and
8,over again and the thing that you have
8,to learn is that you're gonna fail and
8,fail and fail and that's really really
8,difficult for the type of people that
8,are going into a PhD to learn to fail
8,over and over and over again and
8,continue to keep going and I think
8,that's the biggest piece of advice is if
8,you want to be able to do a PhD what you
8,have to be okay with is being able to
8,fail if you're able to fail and learn
8,from your mistake and continue going
8,you're gonna be just fine in your PhD
8,but if you're someone that really takes
8,it to heart when you fail and it becomes
8,an issue for you a PhD is gonna be
8,really really hard so that's my biggest
8,piece of advice this is a pretty short
8,video but I am pretty sure this is the
8,biggest thing that you're gonna hear
8,over and over again is a finished
8,dissertations the best dissertation and
8,that's true so keep working to finish
8,that dissertation when you get to the
8,end of the line you're gonna see a lot
8,of people graduating that you're gonna
8,say how in the world did they graduate a
8,finished dissertation that's what it is
8,so keep persevering until you get your
8,experiments done sometimes it's gonna
8,take a lot of work sometimes you're
8,gonna have to ask a lot of professors
8,for help sometimes you're gonna have to
8,ask other students or postdocs or help
8,eventually you will get there everyone
8,does it so just keep working so with
8,that I'll say goodbye
9,hi everyone welcome back to the channel
9,i know it's been a long time since i've
9,posted anything
9,it's been a crazy year for myself i'm
9,sure all of you have had your own
9,experiences with covid and i hope that
9,everybody is staying safe and
9,has some hope that there's a vaccine
9,right around the corner
9,i just wanted to give a brief update and
9,let everyone know that i'm going to
9,start posting videos again
9,i'm going to try to give out more advice
9,on grad school more advice on post docs
9,and more advice about navigating careers
9,in general
9,this year i decided i wanted to change
9,things up i always thought about
9,being an academic and being a pi and i
9,finally got to a point where
9,i wanted to try something new and try
9,something more challenging different
9,than what i've always
9,tried and so i actually left my postdoc
9,position
9,and am working as a scientist and a team
9,lead
9,in an industry setting so maybe in the
9,future i could also include some videos
9,as well as advice on grad school and on
9,a postdoc experience i could also
9,include some ideas about
9,what it's like to transition into
9,industry and the differences between
9,industry and academics
9,this is going to be a really short video
9,i really just wanted to give everyone a
9,heads up that i'm going to start posting
9,videos again
9,and i hope that everyone has a happy
9,healthy and fruitful new year
9,thanks
10,hi everyone welcome back
10,this is probably the video that is going
10,to get the most requests and already has
10,gotten some requests so i thought that i
10,would make it now
10,and that is what is it actually like
10,doing a postdoc at harvard and harvard
10,medical school
10,i'm just a disclaimer before we get
10,started that everyone's mileage is going
10,to vary and that harvard is a big place
10,so whether you're doing your postdoc at
10,the main
10,undergrad campus the medical school an
10,affiliate hospital
10,your experience is going to differ and
10,it's also going to differ depending on
10,your pi
10,so with that i just want to say that
10,these are just my personal experiences
10,and don't necessarily
10,reflect everyone's experience at harvard
10,so with that
10,we'll jump right in and what i'm just
10,going to start off with is by saying
10,that
10,there's a lot of pressure working at
10,harvard
10,and the majority of that pressure
10,comes from yourself of course your pi
10,might put some pressure on and others
10,might but most of the pressure that you
10,get
10,is um within yourself um
10,so for example i would say that the
10,standard
10,hours where i was that people were
10,working in the lab with something around
10,people starting at 8 30 in the morning
10,and working till about
10,6 to 6 30 at night um monday through
10,friday and then on the weekends would
10,come in and do whatever
10,treatments they needed for cells or for
10,mice and that was pretty typical
10,um but there's always somebody that's
10,going to work more than that there's
10,always somebody there early in the
10,morning
10,there's always someone there late at
10,night there's always somebody there
10,all weekend long and you're going to put
10,pressure on yourself as to am i doing
10,enough
10,um when you start in your lab you're
10,going to meet people that have published
10,in nature
10,you're there's going to be more senior
10,postdocs there that are
10,um either senior post-docs or at the
10,junior faculty level which at
10,harvard medical school are is instructor
10,of medicine
10,um and you're going to inevitably meet
10,people that have gotten
10,several grants and gotten publications
10,in really high publications such as
10,nature cell science
10,um and it's going to be intimidating
10,you're going to look at them and you're
10,going to look at yourself and you're
10,going to say
10,wow can i ever really get to that level
10,um you're going to hear stories about
10,pis that are going to tell you that you
10,need to be funded within x amount of
10,time
10,or we're going to kick you out of the
10,lab and i haven't actually seen that
10,happen but you're going to hear stories
10,about that or stories about
10,post-docs competing with each other for
10,projects which again
10,was something i think happened a long
10,time ago and doesn't happen now but
10,you're going to hear these stories and
10,you're going to
10,get this kind of knot in your stomach of
10,do i really belong here
10,so when i started i was coming out of a
10,small grad school
10,and did well for myself i published
10,several manuscripts several reviews i
10,had
10,a lot of co-authorships i had applied
10,for
10,a pre-doctoral fellowship on the way out
10,the door so i had gotten some grant
10,writing experience under my belt
10,and it picked up a training grant this
10,summer leading into my
10,postdoc so i already had my own funding
10,going in
10,so i felt pretty good about myself
10,but when you get there it's a different
10,league things move
10,very quickly and i quickly felt
10,overwhelmed and quickly felt like i
10,didn't belong
10,and i would say that lasted for the
10,first
10,five months or so where i felt really
10,under prepared i felt like
10,i'm totally out of my league that i
10,thought i was smart enough when i
10,started but
10,maybe actually i wasn't intelligent
10,enough maybe i didn't work as hard as
10,other people
10,um and it really got to me and i was at
10,the point where i was working
10,you know my long hours during the week
10,and i was there all day on saturday i
10,was there all day on sunday and i was
10,working
10,at one point for a few months every
10,single day
10,i was in the lab trying to perfect
10,technique
10,trying to learn some new things trying
10,to get better
10,and i remember that i sat down with an
10,older postdoc
10,who i looked up to in the lab and i was
10,telling him about
10,the kind of troubles i was having and
10,feeling like maybe i just don't
10,fit in here and i remember what he told
10,me
10,really clearly and this was some of the
10,best the best thing i'd ever heard from
10,him is he goes
10,you know when i started here i felt the
10,same way
10,and i worked for the first year
10,and literally none of the data that i
10,got from my first year are going to be
10,in the manuscript i'm publishing now in
10,cell metabolism
10,and i said really he said yeah and guess
10,what
10,it's the same for everyone in the lab
10,and i after that
10,went and talked with more of the senior
10,postdocs that were in my lab
10,and realized they all felt the same way
10,every single one of them
10,had the most severe case of imposter
10,syndrome
10,i've ever seen every single one from my
10,lab and from others all felt the same
10,way
10,yeah when i started i felt like i was
10,totally out of my league i felt like i
10,was stupid that i didn't belong
10,that i didn't work as hard as other
10,people and
10,the first year was miserable and this
10,was something that
10,i think almost 100 of the people
10,expressed to me as i talked
10,and so my first piece of advice is that
10,if you are considering doing a
10,post doc at harvard don't
10,let the internal pressure get to you
10,because i promise you the internal
10,pressure you're going to get is going to
10,be so much more
10,than anything you're going to get from
10,your pi or from other post docs most of
10,them are really friendly
10,know what you're going through but the
10,internal pressure you put on yourself
10,is going to be so tremendous
10,my second piece of advice that i want to
10,give to everybody
10,is that you don't need to publish an ncs
10,paper to be successful
10,so for those of you that don't know ncs
10,is nature cell science
10,you don't need to publish one of those
10,to be successful
10,so i know post docs
10,that were at my institute that had
10,gotten every grant that you could think
10,of
10,published nature papers and seemed like
10,the perfect candidates for jobs
10,and for months and months and over a
10,year have been trying to land
10,faculty positions and just could not
10,and then i know other people that went
10,through the same exact institute
10,got some grants published decent papers
10,with
10,you know an impact factor of 8 9 10
10,maybe 11 and that was it never published
10,that really high impact paper
10,and landed faculty positions at
10,major research institutes like ohio
10,state university
10,um yes publishing good papers is
10,important and i think a lot of people
10,put a lot of
10,pressure on that but when you really
10,spend time talking to faculty members
10,that are recruiting other post-docs
10,they're gonna tell you that that's not
10,the only thing they're looking for and
10,in fact
10,i've seen some really stellar candidates
10,get beaten up just because
10,they weren't the right fit for the
10,department that the department was
10,looking for somebody with a particular
10,skill set
10,and the person that had that skill set
10,didn't have a nature paper
10,and sometimes that's the way it happens
10,so don't feel that you need to publish
10,in one of these journals to have a
10,successful postdoc
10,also if you're not thinking about going
10,into academics and you're like me and
10,you end up moving
10,into industry you don't need that type
10,of publication anyways
10,just publishing anything is good so what
10,you really need to do when you go into
10,your postdoc
10,similar to grad school but maybe a
10,little bit more now that you have more
10,freedom is
10,you need your kind of stretch project
10,something that
10,is a little bit high risk high reward
10,and then you also need something more
10,attainable that you know if you
10,chop away at it for the next couple
10,years that you're gonna get a
10,publication
10,that's my second piece of advice
10,my third piece of advice is to publish
10,early
10,now this is something that they don't
10,tell you but is a really
10,big piece of advice published by the
10,third year
10,the reason for that is because one your
10,pi
10,is going to expect it and they may not
10,tell you right away i know that my pi
10,didn't tell me right away oh you need to
10,publish something by your third year
10,but i had a senior postdoc in the lab
10,that told me when his third year came
10,around the
10,rpi went to him and basically said
10,where's the paper
10,it's been three years um and this is an
10,attitude that extends beyond just
10,harvard
10,when you're applying for a fellowship
10,having a paper
10,after three years shows you are
10,productive if you get to your third year
10,and you don't have a publication
10,the review panel is going to look at you
10,as somebody that's been unproductive in
10,your post doc
10,so definitely make sure that you spend
10,time working on something that you could
10,publish in
10,within the first few years and i would
10,say the expectation is
10,to have your first publication out with
10,in about your third year
10,and then a publication every year after
10,that that is typically what they're
10,expecting
10,um so that's kind of a hidden gem if you
10,will
10,something that they really don't teach
10,you or stress to you but
10,i've found as i've gone and as far as
10,getting um
10,promotions as far as getting grants
10,as far as the way your own pi is going
10,to look at you the three-year mark
10,should be your goal
10,for trying to publish something
10,and then my next piece of advice
10,is to just soak it in so
10,the typical work week as a postdoc at
10,harvard medical school
10,or harvard varies i would say most work
10,eight to six you're going to go in on
10,the weekends and that's normal
10,but you're always going to have people
10,that are working night and day you're
10,always going to have people that are
10,there all weekend
10,you need to know when to call it quits
10,and when to basically say enough is
10,enough
10,and i think i was one of those people
10,when i first started
10,as are a lot of people that kind of work
10,all around the clock because they think
10,that's what's expected of them
10,and as you learn to start dropping that
10,self pressure
10,you start self-regulating a little bit
10,better and saying okay
10,this is basically what i can accomplish
10,in a week and
10,this is the time i'm going to set aside
10,to do it but your growth
10,in harvard is more than just
10,the time you spend at the bench and you
10,actually do
10,more growing outside of the bench than
10,you do at the bench so you're going to
10,have your internal seminars your
10,external seminars
10,hopefully you have your weekly lab
10,meetings especially if you're in a
10,bigger
10,lab you're going to have your
10,we called it a data group but there's
10,different names for them
10,kind of a science forum type setting
10,where you have several labs that meet
10,together and talk and present
10,and this is where you're going to grow
10,the most this is where you're going to
10,see people
10,presenting raw data you're going to see
10,how the top people in your respective
10,fields critique the data
10,how they pick it apart how they look for
10,better hypotheses to move forward
10,and you really are going to learn the
10,scientific method better here
10,than you will anywhere else and that was
10,one of the things that i
10,think i learned the best at harvard was
10,when i went there i thought i learned
10,the scientific method and the process of
10,science
10,from the time that i started from the
10,time that i left much better
10,the way that you think about an idea
10,form the correct hypothesis test it
10,uh structure your experiments the
10,elegance of your experiments the details
10,that you can go
10,um the training that you get from these
10,types of seminars is second to none
10,it seriously is and no matter how much
10,you think you know about this
10,i thought that i knew it when i went in
10,that okay i got this like
10,of course i know the scientific method i
10,i have my phd
10,i of course i know how to design
10,experiments but the types of experiments
10,and the way that you go about
10,parsing data um you will just grow
10,astronomically and be okay with that be
10,ready to grow and take advantage of all
10,of this and
10,and don't be afraid to ask questions um
10,even if it's afterwards go up to the
10,professor hey
10,why did you ask this question in this
10,way what are you thinking or go to
10,a postdoc hey why did you structure your
10,data this way or why did you make your
10,graphs this way
10,don't be afraid to ask this is the time
10,that you are seriously going to grow
10,my last piece of advice i think i have
10,is just have fun with it
10,um you're going to fail a lot there
10,um and if it wasn't already beaten out
10,of you in grad school it will definitely
10,be beaten out of you when you do your
10,postdoc at harvard
10,you're going to fail you are always
10,there's always somebody smarter in the
10,room than you which i think is an
10,excellent thing i think that you should
10,always strive to be the stupidest person
10,in the room
10,if you're in a room and you're the
10,smartest person in the room
10,you're not making yourself any better
10,when you're surrounded by people that
10,are
10,exponentially smarter than you and more
10,accomplished than you
10,that's how you grow as a person and at
10,harvard there's going to be no shortage
10,of people that are smarter than you it
10,doesn't matter how smart you are
10,there's always someone smarter than you
10,and there's always going to be a nobel
10,laureate there's always going to be
10,somebody that's won
10,more awards gotten more grants published
10,more papers
10,no shortage and so don't be afraid to
10,soak it in
10,have fun learn this is seriously
10,the most freedom you're ever gonna get
10,because you're going to be able to
10,explore
10,new areas test new techniques um
10,really parse the edge of
10,scientific knowledge in an institute
10,that's well
10,funded hopefully with a pi that's well
10,funded
10,so you're not really worrying about
10,footing the bill
10,and if something doesn't work it's not
10,quite your lab that's
10,you know skewed in a different direction
10,so don't be afraid to do that
10,and also don't be afraid to take with
10,you some of your expertise so when you
10,join a lab
10,hopefully you're joining a lab that's
10,slightly different than what you did
10,don't be afraid to take some of your own
10,knowledge with you
10,i know that i came from an aging lab a
10,biology of aging lab
10,and even though i was in a metabolism
10,lab i did
10,focus on some aging related projects and
10,was sort of
10,the expert if you will in that area
10,don't be afraid to
10,to kind of put your foot forward with
10,that um
10,so i hope this kind of helps if there's
10,any other questions about what it's like
10,to do a postdoc at
10,harvard i'm more than happy to to talk
10,about it i think
10,i pretty much summed everything up and
10,that is that
10,the pressure that you're going to get is
10,so large and it's mainly internal
10,pressure and it's pressure that you're
10,going to put on yourself
10,and that's fine you know don't let it
10,get to you too much
10,some pressure is good but don't let it
10,get to you
10,i would say that the hours are pretty
10,standard maybe a little bit longer than
10,where you work
10,everywhere else the biggest difference
10,is going to be the speed
10,um things here move very quickly and
10,you're
10,you're really learning new techniques
10,and you're
10,going to be in an institute where
10,there's going to be a paper published in
10,nature biotechnology with this new
10,technique like a new crispr technique
10,and the next week even though it's brand
10,new your pi is going to say let's
10,implement this into our work and so
10,you're really going to have to be ready
10,to get
10,hit the ground running and do things at
10,an
10,astronomically fast pace but i think
10,that
10,going through this you're going to grow
10,and mature so much i think i even grew
10,and matured
10,more during my post-doc than i did
10,during grad school which says a lot
10,because i think
10,your grad school years are your most
10,formative years in terms of a scientist
10,and growing as a young adult but i think
10,as a postdoc i think this is where
10,you're
10,if you do it at harvard you will
10,actually grow more there than you did in
10,grad school
10,which says a lot about the experience
10,so definitely take advantage of it if
10,you get the opportunity
10,um yeah with that i'd like to say thanks
10,for watching and i'll catch you guys in
10,the next one
10,bye
11,so you're at the end of grad school
11,you've already applied for some postdoc
11,positions and you've gotten a couple
11,interviews
11,one of the things you're going to have
11,to do at your interviews is prepare a
11,presentation to talk about the work that
11,you did in grad school
11,and that's exactly what we're going to
11,talk about today how important is it
11,and what do you need to do to prepare
11,and how are you going to succeed in
11,doing it
11,so obviously when i applied for
11,post-docs i did
11,several of these and not only did i do
11,several of these but when i was a
11,postdoc i watched
11,a lot of these and so i have some ideas
11,about
11,what i think made really good
11,presentations and what made really bad
11,presentations
11,so in terms of a presentation for
11,a postdoc position it's a little
11,different than a presentation that you
11,might do on an
11,internal or external seminar or
11,something that you might do at it
11,at a conference so let's talk about what
11,some of the differences are
11,i think that the main goal that you need
11,to keep in mind
11,when doing your presentation is that you
11,need to do
11,two things the first thing is you need
11,to be able to give a brief background of
11,yourself
11,and then you need to walk the people
11,from
11,point a which is the larger question
11,that you're trying to answer and then be
11,how your research
11,answers said a question
11,and i know that that's typical for a
11,presentation
11,but i'm going to go into detail about
11,how it's a little bit different in this
11,situation
11,so the first thing that you're going to
11,need to do is introduce yourself
11,and you're not going to usually do this
11,in a presentation but i think for the
11,purposes of a postdoc
11,presentation it's okay and actually
11,pretty good you know i've seen people
11,give background about like what country
11,they're from
11,of course in academics it's a you know
11,multi-racial multinational
11,um area of work and so embrace it let
11,people know
11,hey this is where i come from this is
11,where i went to school
11,you know this is my wife or kids um
11,pets this is you know where i've been in
11,life
11,it's actually really interesting getting
11,to to know that about people
11,and it also lets them to start thinking
11,about
11,would i get along with this person
11,because this is one of the things that's
11,ultimately going to happen is the pi is
11,going to go to the post docs or grad
11,students and say
11,hey would you get along with person x
11,yes of course the science is important
11,but the less that they have to manage
11,interpersonal conflict the better and so
11,they're really looking to see if you're
11,gonna all get along so
11,make it a little personal it's gonna
11,help you to stand out
11,now the next thing you're gonna have to
11,do is demonstrate a clear hypothesis
11,and to do this you're gonna have to
11,frame your research
11,with what the current literature is the
11,current
11,knowledge of the field and you need to
11,do this in a
11,very very very and i can't stress this
11,enough
11,clear manner because it is
11,most likely that you're going to
11,interview at a lab
11,that doesn't do exactly what you do
11,so for example you may be in a metabolic
11,field which is what i was in
11,i studied uh thermogenic fat
11,thermogenic brown fat but what if i was
11,in an
11,interviewing in another lab that was
11,doing something related to
11,kidney or to the energetics of the heart
11,or to the liver you know muscle there's
11,a whole bunch of other labs that are
11,metabolic labs that i could have gone to
11,for a post-doc interview
11,but they don't know what
11,thermogenic fat is now this is just an
11,example but
11,of course it's going to vary from person
11,to person but you need to keep in mind
11,that
11,likely especially if it's a big
11,departmental
11,uh interview
11,they're not going to have the same
11,background as you they're not going to
11,know the literature you know
11,they're not going to know all of the
11,terminology you know
11,they're not going to know what the big
11,problems in your field are
11,so you need to more than you normally
11,would
11,hold their hand and walk them through
11,each step
11,and the first thing you have to do is
11,define
11,the terminology that you're going to use
11,what's the big problem in the field
11,and kind of how do you plan to address
11,it what is your overarching hypothesis
11,so i'm in field x
11,there is this problem in the field we
11,hypothesize
11,this is what's happening and this is how
11,we're gonna go
11,about testing it that is really
11,crucial that you set that up from the
11,beginning because if that's not set up
11,from the beginning
11,you're going to lose all of your
11,audience and i've seen some people that
11,i have no doubt had really
11,really killer data and nailed some
11,important questions
11,but they did not set it up clearly from
11,myself or the rest of the audience in
11,the beginning
11,and they lost us and it was over within
11,the first five to ten minutes of the
11,presentation
11,and the rest of the presentation i'm
11,just kind of looking at the clock
11,waiting for it to finish
11,and that happens all the time so the
11,beginning part needs to be
11,really clear along the same lines
11,as you're going through and you're
11,explaining the data that you have
11,keep in mind not everybody's going to be
11,as up-to-date with all of the techniques
11,as
11,as you are so obviously there are
11,certain techniques that
11,most labs are going to use so most
11,people understand what's a western blot
11,what's qpcr
11,or what's an elisa um but i'm sure every
11,single lab out there has specific
11,techniques
11,that are going to be different and even
11,if they are similar
11,you need to stress variables within
11,there that could change so for example
11,most people are familiar with how
11,microscopy works so if you do confocal
11,microscopy for example and you could
11,have
11,different stains they look really pretty
11,they're nice
11,but what is the green stain in your
11,slide
11,is it something that every single person
11,is going to know what that means
11,why is it important so it's not just
11,defining in my
11,um in my field of view here the green
11,stain represents
11,x protein it's defining exactly
11,why is it important that i'm showing
11,that that it does this and this is why
11,i'm staining it
11,oh these are the genes that i'm looking
11,at and not just saying that
11,blank genes are involved in
11,the electron transport chain no like
11,what does each one do
11,let the people know take them step by
11,step
11,hold their hand and it's even more
11,important for this because
11,what the pi is looking for is
11,one how well do you know your stuff so
11,do you have any idea what's going on or
11,are you somebody that basically is
11,getting their degree because
11,the pi gave you a project and kind of
11,held your hand
11,and took you through it or are you
11,someone that like really is in command
11,of your stuff
11,and they're gonna look for how you tie
11,everything together
11,um the next thing is make sure as you're
11,going along that you give credit to
11,yourself
11,so this is where you can really show
11,yourself off
11,you've got a illustration in there
11,that's from a review
11,article that you wrote boom make sure
11,that you give yourself credit in the
11,footer of your slide that like this is
11,your publication
11,you've published this data that you're
11,presenting boom
11,put it in the footer and say you know
11,this is work that i already published in
11,this journal
11,at the beginning of your talk i'm going
11,to talk about story x which was
11,published here
11,there's a few other stories that i
11,published that i haven't talked
11,about because of you know just one story
11,but this is one in particular i want to
11,talk about
11,at the end oh i had this pre-doctoral
11,fellowship or this
11,stipend or or what have you you know
11,show that off let them know
11,i have these accolades this is a nice
11,way to kind of pepper it in and kind of
11,puff yourself up without actually coming
11,across as
11,like a show-off um
11,the last thing that's really important
11,is envisioning where your work is going
11,to go
11,and i think this may be maybe
11,just as important if not as important as
11,the actual research itself so
11,when you're doing this try to answer the
11,question
11,if i had another 10 years left in the
11,lab where would i take this
11,so i think what grad students struggle
11,with the most
11,is they can come up with a hypothesis
11,they could come up with an experiment to
11,test it with all the right controls and
11,everything they could get the data
11,analyze it interpret it and they could
11,kind of form the next hypothesis and i
11,think that's
11,that's the issue is grad students will
11,form a hypothesis
11,they will outline specifically what
11,their
11,next step is and
11,then they're done and that's the big
11,bridge that you need to cap is yes it's
11,it's nice to say okay
11,now based on the work that i did these
11,are the next one or two
11,experiments that i would do but
11,talk long term so not just what is the
11,next experiment that i could do but
11,but for example if my hypotheses are
11,right
11,this is where it's going to play out
11,long term
11,um not oh it's going to cure a disease
11,but that intermediate steps so for
11,example
11,um you did a study
11,where you did some kind of
11,proteomic analysis proteomics are all
11,the rage nowadays
11,so you did a proteomic screen and you
11,found a protein and you
11,verified that this protein does x in the
11,tissue and now you've published it and
11,that's what you're going to present on
11,what you'll see a lot of grad students
11,do is say well
11,now i'm going to follow up by um
11,giving this protein to a mouse or
11,knocking this protein out on a mouse
11,yeah that's interesting and that's the
11,next logical step but like what
11,after that you know this protein is
11,involved in this and so we're going to
11,use this specific model and we're going
11,to test it in this way
11,to try to test this specific disease and
11,after that maybe we want to align with
11,you know this biotech company because
11,they have the resources to be able to
11,help us with a disease model and
11,you know going on and on and on these
11,are the types of things that they want
11,to see
11,the big picture where does your research
11,really fit in
11,um because it's your project isn't just
11,in a vacuum it's not just
11,one project it fits into a bigger scope
11,and that's the
11,biggest thing that they're going to be
11,looking for
11,the last thing that they're going to be
11,looking for is how you answer questions
11,and to me the question section or the q
11,a
11,section of a presentation really is
11,for a grad student the dead giveaway of
11,how much work they did versus their pi
11,um i've seen a few
11,people over the years that have given
11,presentations that were like
11,the most stellar presentations i'm
11,talking
11,um beautiful animations beautifully
11,well-designed
11,slides it was so well rehearsed and
11,polished
11,it was like a presidential speech um the
11,data looked
11,beautiful and then when it came to the q
11,a it just
11,fell apart and that's because what you
11,could tell is that these people
11,really didn't understand what their
11,project is um
11,so for example if you give a
11,presentation
11,and then one of the questions is okay if
11,you had
11,say unlimited funds how would you do
11,your
11,study differently or what other
11,experiments would you add
11,or kind of what would your next
11,direction be if i if money wasn't an
11,issue
11,you could just do anything under you
11,know in the world what would you do
11,and if you answer with crickets it kind
11,of means to me that you have
11,no creativity okay like what would you
11,do
11,okay well this is i really want to do
11,this rna-seq experiment you know that's
11,something i really want to do but it's
11,just too expensive we haven't been able
11,to do it
11,okay well now that you have funds you
11,would do that
11,um okay so you told me what
11,like your data means but how does it
11,answer this
11,fundamental question or where does it
11,stand in with this
11,crickets um so you're you're showing
11,this data
11,but in your introduction you didn't
11,really
11,demonstrate how your data aligns with
11,authors a b and c who are you know
11,pis at the institute you're interviewing
11,in
11,and your data contradicts theirs you
11,know where how do you reconcile
11,your data contradicting theirs crickets
11,that's a problem and so i think that the
11,q a section is something that you
11,really need to practice with your pi
11,because
11,it's seriously a dead giveaway for
11,people that that didn't prepare and
11,don't really know what their project is
11,but i think really in general that's the
11,scope of the presentation is they're
11,going to be looking for like
11,who are you what techniques do you know
11,and maybe are they transferable
11,how do you present to yourself how do
11,you
11,not just present your your work but like
11,yourself
11,and you know how does all your work fit
11,in
11,how well do you understand it how well
11,are you able to explain it
11,because that's something that they they
11,just don't want to have to teach you as
11,a postdoc is like how to understand your
11,work and present your work
11,they want you to already have a good
11,idea of how to do that
11,um and so i think that overall
11,the presentation part of a postdoc
11,interview is actually a decently
11,important part
11,i think it's one of those that kind of
11,gets overlooked that people think oh
11,well i got this interview and
11,you know now i'm good but i think that
11,i've seen
11,several people that have interviewed for
11,postdocs that really did
11,bomb this part and i think it really
11,it threw out their chance of ever
11,landing the postdoc that they wanted
11,so make sure you take it seriously
11,so with that thanks for watching and
11,i'll see you in the next one bye
12,welcome back everyone today we're going
12,to start part one of a three-part series
12,about transitioning to industry from
12,academics
12,today we're going to talk about a high
12,level overview about
12,what it's like to work in industry and
12,some of the advantages and disadvantages
12,and part two we're going to be talking
12,about networking and how you could try
12,to get yourself some interviews to move
12,to industry
12,and then in part three we're going to
12,talk about actually getting your foot in
12,the door and what it's like to actually
12,start the job
12,in industry so let's start with just a
12,high level overview in case anyone's not
12,as familiar and then from there we'll go
12,into a brief overview of some
12,differences from academics and then
12,we're going to go
12,into some advantages and disadvantages
12,so
12,from a high level perspective whether
12,you go to a big company like big pharma
12,pfizer
12,merck novartis or you go to a startup
12,the companies are going to be structured
12,fairly similarly
12,at the very top you're going to have
12,your c suite which is going to be your
12,ceo
12,cfo et cetera underneath there are going
12,to be different vps so a vp and finance
12,vp and
12,drug discovery vpn biology underneath
12,the vps are going to be directors and
12,again these are going to be in specific
12,groups so a director of biology a
12,director of
12,bioanalytical sciences um
12,underneath there are going to be your
12,your scientist track which is going to
12,consist of scientists
12,senior scientists and principal
12,scientists and these are going to for
12,the most part be phds
12,and underneath those are going to be
12,your associate track
12,associate scientists senior associate
12,scientists and principal associate
12,scientists and these are going to be a
12,mixture of masters and bachelor degree
12,individuals now
12,the main difference that i'm going to be
12,talking about
12,is more for a scientist track and people
12,that are coming from a postdoc but
12,some of this may also apply to someone
12,that has a master's degree and did some
12,lab work as a masters um so let's just
12,talk
12,briefly about a couple of the
12,differences that you're going to notice
12,moving from academics to industry
12,so i think one of the biggest things
12,you're going to notice is the amount of
12,time you spend at the bench
12,so when you're doing your post doc
12,you're going to spend nearly all of your
12,time at the bench
12,when you move into industry it's not
12,going to be quite that way
12,in fact about a quarter of your time is
12,most likely going to be taken up by
12,meetings these are going to be
12,one-on-ones
12,um business meetings planning meetings
12,um
12,personnel meetings there's going to be a
12,lot more meetings
12,particularly if you're like me and you
12,have managerial
12,roles in your job and you have to manage
12,multiple people
12,you may not spend any time at the bench
12,or close to no time at the bench
12,which is of course very different than
12,when you
12,are in academics and you're spending
12,almost all of your time at the bench
12,now that's not going to be a hundred
12,percent true there are some people that
12,are going to come in at a scientist
12,level and still spend the vast majority
12,of their time at the bench
12,but in general you're going to be
12,spending less time at the bench i think
12,that's
12,just sort of a given especially with the
12,amount of meetings that you have to do
12,um another difference that you're going
12,to notice is the amount of hours you
12,work
12,now again this is going to depend on the
12,department that you're in and whether
12,you're at a small
12,cap startup or if you're going to be at
12,you know big pharma
12,the bigger the company in general the
12,less hours you're going to work
12,startups need a lot more work to get
12,going off the ground and that's why
12,you're going to end up working more
12,hours there
12,and if you could go to a more
12,established company you may end up
12,working
12,closer to that 40 hour mark which is
12,going to be vastly different than when
12,you're working
12,as a postdoc and you know the more times
12,the centrifuge spins
12,the more data you get and so you end up
12,working a lot more there
12,um i think that there's also going to be
12,a lot less
12,oversight when you're in industry you're
12,going to have one person that's of
12,course your direct manager but
12,there's going to be a lot less checking
12,in versus i think when you're a postdoc
12,and
12,you're going to have a pi that kind of
12,wants to know what you're doing because
12,they need to know for grants etc
12,here when you're in industry you're
12,probably going to check in in your
12,weekly meeting and that's about it and
12,you may not have quite as much oversight
12,so you're going to have a little bit
12,more
12,leeway in that but from there i kind of
12,want to
12,move on to talking about what are the
12,differences between
12,working in academics and working in
12,industry in terms of the pros and the
12,cons
12,so if you want a more detailed video
12,about
12,what an actual day in the life is like
12,of somebody that's a phd working
12,industry
12,let me know in the comments below and
12,i'm happy to make that video
12,now this kind of pros and cons is going
12,to be more directed towards
12,not necessarily a postdoc but um a pi so
12,if you were a pi in academics versus
12,um say a director in industry what are
12,the pros and the cons of this
12,um so let's start with flexibility this
12,is definitely a pro for
12,for uh academics in industry they're
12,gonna tell you from
12,way much higher up what you're going to
12,be researching
12,and even if you yourself make it to one
12,of those higher levels
12,you don't necessarily get to always make
12,those decisions there's a board of
12,directors
12,there's other c-suite people in the
12,company
12,in academics you get to run the show and
12,do it the way you want to do it
12,and in industry it doesn't work that way
12,there's always somebody that's going to
12,have
12,input besides you so you need to be a
12,little more malleable
12,in an industry position whereas in
12,academics you can kind of run things
12,the way you want to run it now what you
12,gain in flexibility in academics you
12,lose in pay
12,so if you're a professor and especially
12,if you make it up to a chair
12,you can make good money in academics i
12,don't
12,think that many of the pis are really
12,hurting for money
12,um but in industry the pay is much more
12,your base salary is going to be much
12,higher
12,the bonuses that you get every year add
12,on to the
12,money you take in you'll get stock
12,options every year
12,you'll get a new hire option grant
12,you'll get even sometimes a new hire
12,sign-on bonus as well
12,the amount of money that you can make in
12,industry is a lot
12,more not only that your 401k options
12,tend to be a lot better and you get an
12,employer match so you're better set up
12,for retirement
12,um so you got to remember that's a huge
12,draw for industry and a lot of people
12,really enjoy that
12,um but again there are still advantages
12,to academics
12,ownership is one so ownership and the
12,ability to
12,um claim things as your own and
12,there are people that are egomaniacs and
12,they need to control everything and be
12,in charge of everything and so of course
12,ownership is going to matter but even
12,for people that aren't like that
12,a lot of scientists like being able to
12,take ownership of their work they like
12,being able to say
12,um i did this specific experiment or
12,this specific project and these were the
12,outcomes and
12,this is how i've moved my field forward
12,that is one of the most rewarding parts
12,of science is being able to say
12,this is what i've done to directly
12,impact my field
12,and now others can build off the work
12,that i did
12,um that's awesome and one of the best
12,feelings
12,in industry you don't really get that
12,kind of ownership
12,uh everything that you do is gonna be
12,touched by at least a dozen other people
12,um so your ownership is a small slice of
12,a much larger pie
12,in industry um
12,with that being said there is the
12,advantage in industry of translatability
12,now i know that people that are die hard
12,in academics can harp on this one
12,but this is going to be some cold hard
12,truth
12,the translatability in academics is
12,next to none in academics we
12,always start off our papers or
12,end papers grants presentations
12,we talk about this is the disease that
12,i'm targeting i am targeting this
12,disease and then we go off about
12,mechanism and
12,how what we're doing can directly impact
12,the disease individual
12,and don't get me wrong there are people
12,that have
12,gone from academics and started their
12,own companies
12,and have produced drugs based off of
12,what they did
12,in their academic life there are labs
12,that have come up with really cool ideas
12,and inventions and technologies that
12,a company has said that's awesome let's
12,buy that from you you know let me buy
12,that i
12,intellectual property ip from you
12,that is less than 10 of the cases the
12,overwhelming majority of the time
12,the pis are so swamped with trying to
12,get the next paper or chasing the next
12,grant
12,that most of what they do isn't all
12,translatable
12,and that's fine mechanism and moving
12,fields forward is really important and
12,industry takes these forward leaps and
12,uses that in their own stuff but
12,most of what you see is never going to
12,make it to the bedside
12,in industry though you are literally
12,making a drug
12,and having your hands in drugs that are
12,going to be
12,given to patients so if you want that
12,translatability
12,aspect being able to say what i did
12,directly impacted a patient
12,industry is definitely the way to go
12,um and one last pro of
12,industry is the grants you don't have to
12,chase
12,grants or high impact papers
12,it's really good if you publish in
12,industry but it's not
12,always necessary your company is going
12,to fund your research you don't need to
12,get the next
12,ro1 to keep your lab going or worry
12,about how you're going to find
12,funding to do you know this experiment
12,that you need for your grant
12,um you get out of that vicious cycle
12,that's something to also consider is do
12,you want that kind of pressure for the
12,rest of your life
12,um but at the same time there's other
12,pressures that go into industry
12,so volatility is something in academics
12,especially if you're tenured
12,once you have your position you're
12,pretty set like you don't
12,have to worry about your job
12,disappearing in industry it's not that
12,way your
12,job can disappear any day without any
12,warning
12,if you're in certain types of work like
12,bioanalytical sciences or dmpk
12,those are areas that kind of the whole
12,company relies on and so your job may be
12,a little bit more stable
12,but for most of the positions out there
12,a company could come to you and say
12,we're cutting your division
12,you know i'm sorry you're gone and they
12,just lay off the whole division and this
12,is from
12,small to large companies you're not
12,necessarily protected
12,and so there's very few people i know in
12,industry that weren't laid off at one
12,point
12,so if you're not okay with having to
12,jump ship and move to another company
12,you know maybe academics is more for you
12,but with that i'm going to start
12,wrapping this video up i don't want it
12,to go too long especially because we
12,have
12,two more parts to this video but if
12,there's anything in particular in this
12,video that you want me to elaborate on
12,more let me know in the comments i can
12,always make follow-up videos that go
12,more in-depth about the differences
12,between academics and industry
12,so if you like the video please like it
12,and i'll catch you guys in the next one
12,thank you
13,welcome back everyone today we're going
13,to be talking about the differences
13,between grad school and a postdoc
13,this is going to be a shorter video as
13,there's not a ton that's different but i
13,think it's important to point out some
13,of the differences especially ones that
13,you may not be aware of and some of the
13,common pitfalls that people fall into
13,so odds are if you're watching this
13,video you have some grad school
13,experience that you can use on
13,as a reference point and then we could
13,talk about how things may be similar or
13,different when you go to your postdoc
13,so let's start from the beginning when
13,you first join the lab i think one of
13,the most
13,common misconceptions that people have
13,when they start a postdoc is that they
13,think
13,i've already done my phd i know what i'm
13,doing
13,i'm gonna do great i'm gonna kill it
13,from day one certainly that was my
13,expectation when i went and it is
13,totally
13,wrong i've seen myself and many other
13,tremendous scientists
13,that have gone from their grad school
13,into a postdoc having nailed grad school
13,and it's like starting over from ground
13,zero
13,you're gonna learn a lot of new
13,techniques there's a lot to learn in
13,terms of material
13,and even if you do something that's
13,similar there's still gonna be new
13,things that you're gonna have to do
13,and ways that you're going to grow don't
13,get frustrated if the first few months
13,of your postdoc you feel like you're
13,doing nothing but repeating experiments
13,and nothing's working and you feel like
13,a first year grad
13,student again that is par for the course
13,don't feel bad i know that some people
13,have told me that they spent the whole
13,first year of their postdoc
13,and none of the data that they generated
13,was useful for their paper down the road
13,that's gonna happen you know don't sweat
13,it
13,so be ready for that in terms of
13,independence this is another area that i
13,think people
13,are going to falter a little bit now
13,this of course depends
13,on the pi that you have but i think one
13,of the big expectations
13,that they're going to have of you is
13,that you're much more independent you're
13,much better at finding the literature by
13,yourself
13,and obviously reading it and staying on
13,top of it you're much
13,better at conducting your experiments
13,and planning your week and
13,they're going to expect you to be able
13,to take ownership and leadership of your
13,own work that's something that some
13,post-docs are going to be able to do
13,like right away
13,their pis are very hands-off in in grad
13,school to begin with
13,certainly that was the case for me my
13,grad school advisor was fantastic
13,in so many ways um but he was not a
13,hands-on
13,he was not a hands-on advisor he had the
13,attitude of
13,i already have my phd if you want to get
13,your phd
13,that's fine but you need to be able to
13,do your own work in your own project
13,and that was actually tough at first
13,but it served me really well because by
13,the time i started my postdoc
13,i already knew how to find all the
13,important literature
13,digest it and really teach myself
13,something new
13,because your postdoc advisor isn't in
13,the business of
13,teaching you all the time necessarily
13,it's some of them will have more of a
13,mentor
13,type relationship with you but a lot of
13,them what they're really
13,they're your boss it's different than a
13,advisor
13,um some people i know when they went to
13,grad school their
13,their advisors really held their hand a
13,lot and that's
13,great and can help you to get your
13,degree but it doesn't serve
13,you well when you go to your postdoc so
13,be ready to have to have
13,independence in the forefront of your
13,mind another big difference is the
13,amount of projects
13,so when you're in grad school you
13,typically have one big project that
13,you're working on
13,sometimes you may have you know one or
13,two other side projects and that's
13,really good
13,especially if you're able to publish all
13,of them but in your postdoc you need to
13,be ready to be juggling
13,many many projects i had five that were
13,ongoing at the same time
13,now there was one or two that were like
13,my main projects and the other two to
13,three were more
13,side projects and exploratory but
13,you're gonna have to be able to juggle
13,multiple projects and that doesn't mean
13,that
13,one hour days for this project the next
13,hours for this one the next hour
13,is for this one what it means is
13,sometimes you may go a week of just
13,working on one specific project
13,or this day is going to be dedicated to
13,one project and
13,the next day's dedicated to another
13,project you're going to need to find a
13,way to balance all that out especially
13,if you're doing
13,work that involves cell culture and
13,molecular work
13,and animal experiments you need to
13,become very efficient at coming in
13,and you know starting your gel for the
13,day and while that's going you do your
13,cell
13,culture and then while you start
13,incubating membranes you're going to the
13,animal facility and taking care of your
13,animals
13,you know you need to start really
13,becoming efficient at that especially
13,because you're going to have to
13,juggle so many projects and it's
13,actually really really
13,really important that you do and i can't
13,stress that enough
13,there's two reasons why i think this is
13,so critical
13,the first reason is that no projects are
13,guaranteed to work
13,so it's always good to have one really
13,big stretch project that like if that
13,works like
13,wow that's going to be the next nature
13,paper like that's great
13,but that can't be your only project you
13,also need a smaller safer project
13,especially because you're going to need
13,to publish something within the first
13,few years of your postdoc so
13,keep that in mind don't just have one
13,huge large stretch project
13,those are great and those can get you a
13,nature paper
13,but that's not going to be the only
13,thing that you need the other thing is
13,that
13,as you move forward in your career
13,whether that's going into industry or
13,going
13,and becoming a pi you're going to need
13,to be able to demonstrate that you could
13,handle multiple projects
13,nobody wants someone that's so narrowly
13,focused that they just have one project
13,that they work on
13,they want someone that's diversified and
13,can work on multiple projects at the
13,same time that kind of project
13,management
13,is mission critical
13,the last piece that's going to be
13,different is the expectations of
13,publishing
13,and securing grants so maybe you were
13,lucky and you
13,applied for some grants as a grad
13,student i think if you did that
13,you're you're way above what most grad
13,students are doing
13,certainly if you're a grad student you
13,should have at least published one paper
13,hopefully you've published more or some
13,review articles or gotten some
13,co-authors co-authorships but you should
13,have some level of publication
13,underneath your belt
13,in a postdoc it's a different ball game
13,most postdoc mentors that i know are
13,going to be
13,requiring you to submit grants they're
13,going to be wanting you to get grants
13,and that's because one they don't want
13,to have to pay the salary and two it's
13,good for your own career development
13,particularly if you want to stay in
13,academics you're going to need to secure
13,grants
13,you need to get training grants
13,fellowships
13,early career development awards like a k
13,award
13,from the nih those are super important
13,and so you need to be able to start
13,preparing yourself mentally to say
13,i'm going to be working on these grants
13,and just like
13,you're going to hear from pis most of
13,those grants aren't going to get funded
13,i know that
13,i started off my postdoc with a training
13,grant and then from there
13,i quickly generated some data and
13,started submitting applications for
13,fellowships at the nih at the ada
13,which is the american diabetes
13,association the american heart
13,association
13,i was applying all over and a lot of
13,them didn't get accepted eventually i
13,did get a fellowship that was accepted
13,but it took
13,tries to do you know even if you think
13,you have a good project and you have a
13,solid foundation and you're doing
13,research in a good lab like sometimes it
13,takes time to get those
13,the other thing is publications so i
13,think that when you apply for a grant
13,they're going to be looking at
13,what is your productivity level and from
13,what i understood from my mentor or
13,you know phd postdoc pi
13,was that by year three you need to have
13,a paper
13,when you apply for grants it's the same
13,thing i had a co-worker that
13,was a tremendous i mean had unbelievable
13,amounts of data like it blew my mind the
13,amount of data that he had
13,and when he went to apply for a
13,fellowship and he was in his fourth year
13,they told them that he was an
13,unproductive scientist because he had
13,gone four years without publishing
13,anything
13,and that by the third year he should
13,have published something
13,the common rule of thumb that i hear
13,particularly if you want to stay in
13,academics is that you should have a
13,paper out by year three
13,and then every year subsequent to that
13,so year four there should be another
13,paper
13,your five should have another and so on
13,and so on
13,so the level of publishing that you're
13,gonna have to do is a lot more and again
13,this goes back to the last point that we
13,talked about
13,in terms of juggling multiple projects
13,that if you're not juggling multiple
13,projects you're not going to be able to
13,publish
13,multiple papers and continue that rapid
13,rate of publishing
13,the last thing that i want to talk about
13,is what it's like leaving so it is
13,quite a bit different you know when i
13,left my
13,lab as a grad student it was kind of
13,heartbreaking i mean
13,that's like your home you really grew
13,and learned and
13,you form a relationship with your mentor
13,and your other lap mates i mean you're
13,you're real close while i did have a lot
13,of sad feelings when i left my postdoc
13,it's a little bit different because
13,there
13,you're you're conducting business you're
13,do you're going there to work
13,and you're going there to grow and and
13,have that career development and don't
13,get me wrong like
13,the relationships that i made in my
13,postdoc are ones that i'm going to keep
13,forever
13,and there are people in that lab i know
13,that 30 40 years from now
13,i'm still going to talk to and have a
13,relationship with i mean
13,i met some of the best people there it's
13,just not the same
13,and it can't be they're two different
13,growth trajectories
13,the other thing is kind of what happens
13,afterwards so after you leave grad
13,school
13,you know you kind of leave 100 behind
13,what you're
13,what you're doing there if you leave a
13,postdoc and you're going to start your
13,own lab
13,you know one of the things you're going
13,to have to negotiate is what things you
13,could take with you whether that's
13,reagents
13,ideas or projects you're going to need
13,to take resources with you
13,also if you're leaving your postdoc it's
13,possible and this
13,again may happen in grad school it
13,depends but certainly when you leave
13,your postdoc
13,odds are you're going to have to keep
13,some level of a working relationship
13,with your pi
13,there's going to be projects that you
13,started that you didn't get to finish
13,and now
13,other postdocs are finishing and you're
13,going to have to provide insight and
13,ideas
13,help write manuscripts kind of review
13,some grants so be ready for them to ask
13,you to do that and that's good
13,you know you should keep those
13,professional relationships going
13,so i think those are some of the bigger
13,points i wanted to highlight in this
13,there are of course other
13,differences that you could keep in mind
13,but those are the major ones
13,so with that you know thank you for
13,watching subscribe

13,this content and i'll see all of you
13,guys in the next one
13,thanks
14,welcome back to the channel everybody
14,today we're going to talk about
14,something that i think is extremely
14,valuable and that is the single best
14,piece of advice that i could give to any
14,scientist
14,so i think that there's a lot out there
14,in terms of qualities that you're going
14,to need to succeed as a scientist such
14,as being smart
14,being curious hard working you know
14,those are all kinds of things that you
14,already know
14,but what is in my opinion the best piece
14,of advice that i could give to any
14,scientist
14,at practically any stage of their career
14,that's what we're going to talk about
14,today so to talk about this
14,i kind of want to bring in a personal
14,story and take you all the way back to
14,when i was a kid
14,i had a couple of neighbors one that
14,lived next door to me and one that lived
14,across the street from me
14,and i loved playing basketball with them
14,but they were a few years older than me
14,in one case they were actually several
14,years older than me
14,and they would always crush me no matter
14,how hard i tried they would always beat
14,me
14,every single time and i remember
14,the best piece of advice i've ever
14,received my whole life
14,came from my dad during that time when i
14,told him
14,you know i really don't like playing
14,with them anymore they're always beating
14,me by a lot
14,it's hard to win and he told me you're
14,never going to get any better at playing
14,basketball if you're playing with people
14,that are just as good as you or that are
14,even worse than you
14,the only way you're going to get better
14,is if you consistently play
14,with people that are better than you and
14,that was something i took to heart
14,and whether it was sports or academics
14,or anything else in life i've always
14,tried to surround myself with other
14,people that i thought were better than
14,me in whatever activity i was doing so
14,if i was
14,doing sports you know who was the best
14,basketball player i wanted to be with
14,that
14,if it was in school who was the smartest
14,kid in the class or
14,group of kids in the class i wanted to
14,study with them and that's something
14,i've tried to do
14,through most of my life including
14,marrying my wife who i think is
14,smarter than me and more successful in
14,life than me i try to stay with her
14,you know she boosts me up so i think
14,that's probably the best piece of advice
14,that i could give
14,to any scientist in their career but
14,especially ones that are starting out
14,is don't be the smartest person in the
14,room don't be afraid to be surrounded by
14,people that
14,are smarter than you or that maybe even
14,work harder than you
14,or that you know are the ones that could
14,just sit there for 10 minutes and study
14,and and they get a
14,perfect a on this on the test you know
14,don't be afraid of that
14,and this is something that's gonna have
14,to follow you through your whole
14,career so for example you know
14,don't be afraid to spend time talking
14,with pis
14,that are very seasoned even if those pis
14,are kind of grisly and you may not want
14,them on your
14,grad school committee on your thesis
14,committee add them anyways
14,because they're the ones that are going
14,to test you over and over and over again
14,and i promise you that if you're willing
14,to go out there and say
14,these are the three pis that i think in
14,my department are the hardest
14,to deal with but they bring the most to
14,the table and you put them on your
14,defense committee
14,even though it's going to be harder
14,through the process
14,when you're done you're going to come
14,out a much better scientist
14,you're going to be smarter you're going
14,to really know how to think through
14,things and you're going to be prepared
14,for the next stage
14,and same thing as you move into your
14,post-doc don't be afraid
14,to work with the smartest post-docs
14,to get involved with the pis that are
14,the most challenging
14,don't ever be afraid to do that if you
14,become a pi
14,or you go into industry later or
14,whatever career
14,same piece of advice and it doesn't
14,matter how seasoned you are
14,you know even if you've been a pi for 10
14,15 20 years
14,there's still probably a pi around that
14,knows more than you
14,that's published more than you that has
14,more funding than you
14,don't be afraid to surround yourself
14,with those that are smarter
14,than you don't ever ever ever
14,be the smartest person in the room
14,that's the best piece of advice that i
14,could give to you
14,now this is would be a really short
14,video if that was the only piece of
14,advice that i could give you
14,so i want to give you one other piece of
14,advice that i think is
14,something that people kind of overlook
14,and need to actually
14,reflect themselves and think about and
14,that is the fact that
14,science and your career is not a sprint
14,it's a marathon okay
14,yeah it's nice if you could finish your
14,phd in three years instead of four years
14,because then that means you get to just
14,that much faster move to a postdoc and
14,if you do your postdoc in three years
14,instead of four years
14,it means you get to advance to the next
14,stage in your career faster and like
14,that's good and all but
14,you know you're really only saving a
14,year or two
14,here or there and in the grand scheme of
14,things it's not that much
14,don't rush make sure to take your time
14,really go through your phd and learn
14,everything you need to learn
14,same with your postdoc once you get to
14,your postdoc don't just leave because
14,you want to leave
14,certainly there's different you know
14,factors such as if you're
14,like me and you're in boston it's
14,extremely expensive to live here it's
14,hard to be a postdoc for so long because
14,you just don't make enough money to to
14,support a family here but
14,um for most people you need to be there
14,until you feel like you've learned
14,everything that you can that you've
14,squeezed every bit of information
14,and career development and growth out of
14,that position that you can't because
14,once you leave you can't go back to that
14,position
14,you know once you leave your phd and you
14,do your defense and you move on to a
14,post-tech
14,you're a phd at that point it doesn't
14,matter whether you're a new postdoc
14,or you're a faculty member they're gonna
14,have a certain
14,expectation for what you know and can do
14,so don't just rush through if you feel
14,like you're not ready yet to move
14,through
14,same thing once you finally make it
14,through when you for example go into
14,industry
14,and you become a scientist in industry
14,don't just try to race through it okay
14,you need to take your time it's a
14,marathon not a sprint
14,those are the two biggest pieces of
14,advice that i can give to everybody
14,that's watching this
14,particularly the first one so if you
14,take your time
14,and you learn everything you can at each
14,stage
14,and really think about how can i grow
14,myself
14,what am i supposed to be doing at this
14,stage of my career to grow
14,is it learning to do experimental
14,techniques
14,is it learning how to write papers is it
14,learning how to manage
14,others is it learning how to manage
14,multiple projects at the same time
14,what am i supposed to be learning at
14,this stage in my career
14,and how can i become as perfect at those
14,skill sets as i can and also while
14,you're doing that
14,surrounding yourself with people that
14,you think are doing better at those than
14,you are
14,and that you can learn from and that you
14,kind of aspire to be
14,you're going to be set you're going to
14,continue to grow at an exponential rate
14,and your growth is going to be much
14,faster
14,than those around you and before long
14,you're going to rise and be part of that
14,cream of the crop if you will
14,so i hope those two pieces of advice are
14,helpful to you
14,certainly they made a huge difference to
14,me and my
14,career development and my growth as a
14,scientist and they're things that i
14,continue to do and i'm
14,you know even to this day i still try to
14,be
14,you know not the smartest person in the
14,room i always want to make sure there's
14,somebody smarter and
14,more developed and that i can learn from
14,i never want to be
14,the smartest one in the room so with
14,that i hope everyone has a really good
14,long weekend
14,i know we just passed the chinese new
14,year so if you're someone that
14,celebrates a chinese
14,new year have a happy new year and i'll
14,catch you guys in the next one
14,bye
15,welcome back everybody today we're going
15,to pick up with part two of
15,transitioning to industry
15,if you have any thoughts about going to
15,industry this is maybe the most
15,important video that i could give to you
15,because
15,getting your foot in the door in
15,industry is far and away the hardest
15,part
15,so with that let's get started with the
15,first part of the video which is going
15,to be talking about the networking
15,and then the second part will touch upon
15,how to actually apply for some of these
15,positions
15,so the first part is networking so
15,where do you start with this my best
15,recommendation
15,is to start with your current pi or
15,other pis that are in the department or
15,within the campus
15,that you know or talk to pis that you
15,know from your previous work in grad
15,school and ask
15,do you know anyone that you could
15,connect me with that's working in
15,industry
15,even if that person's not specifically
15,themselves hiring
15,that's your best way to get a formal
15,introduction to someone in industry and
15,trust me
15,this is really important okay when i was
15,doing my postdoc we had a career panel
15,where we had people that
15,did their postdoc at the same university
15,as me
15,they since then had gone on into
15,industry and they were coming back to
15,give their
15,um experience and one of the people
15,there she said
15,that industry getting your foot in the
15,door it all starts with a cup of coffee
15,now in today's crazy climate with kovid
15,i'm guessing you're not going to be
15,going out and getting a cup of coffee
15,with somebody
15,but you know what a zoo meeting a phone
15,call that's a great way to start
15,and i actually ended up talking to this
15,person on the phone
15,and you know she had a lot of good
15,experience she
15,went on to be very high up advisor and
15,now she works at the bill and melinda
15,gates foundation
15,she was tremendous but she was able to
15,connect me with
15,other people that she knew in fact she
15,connected me with five other people that
15,i knew
15,and some of those people helped connect
15,me with other people that they knew
15,and next thing i knew i had sort of
15,built this network of people in
15,industry that i knew between her and
15,some other
15,recommendations i had from pis and some
15,people that i had met from
15,collaborations while i was doing my
15,postdoc i had about 30 or 40 people that
15,i knew and i was talking to
15,that were all in industry another thing
15,that i did was actually
15,add some people that i knew had moved to
15,industry that i had prior connections
15,with before
15,whether those were people that i had met
15,at conferences or people that i know
15,used to work closely with some of my pis
15,and i just sent out emails to them you
15,know hi my name is justin you know this
15,is
15,how we met before if you don't remember
15,me or these are the people that you've
15,worked with that i've also worked with
15,i'm thinking about moving into industry
15,put yourself out there another thing
15,that you could do is think about the
15,area of research that you want to be
15,going into
15,so one of the areas that i had studied
15,a lot was biology of aging that was what
15,i did my grad school on and i did some
15,work in
15,in my postdoc on that not the main focus
15,but i had done that was
15,the work i did in grad school well
15,there was a pi at harvard med
15,that's very big in the biology of aging
15,area
15,and he also happens to have good
15,connections within the biotechnology
15,field industry for aging
15,related companies and so i reached out
15,to him and said you know hi i'm justin
15,i'm
15,we haven't met but this is the people
15,i've worked with and what i've worked on
15,and i'm interested in maybe pursuing
15,aging research in an industry setting
15,you know can you take a look at my cv
15,can you you know help me out in any way
15,so i think putting yourself out there is
15,maybe the most important thing that you
15,could do and on that note i'll give one
15,other last piece of advice
15,sometimes people put out there on their
15,linkedin that they're applying for or
15,that they're hiring for a certain
15,position okay i'm hiring a new scientist
15,you know come join my team these kinds
15,of posts happen all the time
15,and yes you do need to actually apply
15,but there's also
15,nothing wrong with taking your cv and
15,cover letter
15,that you're going to use to apply and
15,actually
15,sending it in a direct message on
15,linkedin to whoever
15,is posting that job and saying hey look
15,like i'm applying for this job
15,you know i'm really interested if you
15,have time i'd really love to talk about
15,it
15,you know that kind of personal
15,one-on-one connection can actually make
15,a big difference so
15,don't be afraid to do that so what else
15,can you do
15,my advice is to definitely if you don't
15,make sure you have a linkedin a lot of
15,industry happens on linkedin
15,businesses run that way it's a little
15,different than academics so make sure
15,you have a linkedin and you have it
15,fully filled with all of your
15,information your school what your
15,experience is
15,you're also going to find most of the
15,job postings there
15,places like indeed they don't quite have
15,as good of a
15,amount of jobs i don't think so i think
15,linkedin is a much better
15,source for jobs and you're going to get
15,to be able to like i said
15,maybe message people that are posting
15,jobs or maybe even message
15,a talent acquisition or hr rep that's
15,posting the jobs
15,for the company it's a real good way to
15,to get involved with that
15,and the other advantage is when you do
15,get an interview and we'll talk about
15,this in the next video that we
15,discuss industry is you're going to get
15,a list of people you're going to talk to
15,in that interview
15,and you can go on linkedin and find
15,their pages and get some background
15,information so you could go into the
15,interview prepared to talk to them
15,now the other thing that you're going to
15,need to do is try to find
15,somebody that has some level of
15,understanding about industry and again
15,this goes back to
15,maybe someone that your pi's hooked you
15,up with and say
15,this is the cover letter that i've been
15,using and maybe
15,changing around and this is the cv
15,that i've been using can you give me any
15,pointers because cvs look
15,different in industry than in academics
15,and the cover letter needs to have
15,certain aspects to it
15,now a lot of the applications that
15,you're going to send are going to go
15,through general hr
15,screeners and they're going to be
15,looking for certain buzzwords and these
15,are people that aren't scientists
15,so it's really really really critical
15,that you have certain keywords and that
15,it's laid out in a certain way so that
15,they can
15,identify you as a good target for this
15,position
15,so that's something to keep in mind so
15,now
15,you've already started to build out your
15,network
15,now what you need to be able to do is
15,you need to move over and actually start
15,applying for some of these jobs
15,now when you apply one of the things
15,that you're going to have to do
15,is again try reaching out to these
15,people
15,try saying you know i'm so-and-so and
15,i'm applying for this position this is
15,what i'm interested in
15,something that i want to talk about that
15,i think people don't realize is when you
15,don't have your foot in the door in
15,industry and you're starting to apply
15,you're gonna have to apply for a lot of
15,jobs
15,you're gonna apply and apply and apply
15,and get rejection after rejection
15,and it's gonna you know kind of stink a
15,little bit
15,and i just had someone that i know um a
15,former
15,colleague of mine introduced me to her
15,and she's looking for a job in industry
15,and was looking for advice and i talked
15,to her on the phone for
15,about 20 minutes or so and one of the
15,things she was saying was you know i've
15,been applying for about a month and
15,you know i i haven't heard anything and
15,i've applied for about 20 jobs
15,and i i paused for a second and said 20
15,jobs is nothing you might
15,you know might take a few months and you
15,might need to apply for a couple hundred
15,jobs before you hear
15,something it's a very competitive field
15,out there and there's
15,too many phds out there and not enough
15,jobs in
15,industry so be prepared to have to wait
15,and be prepared to apply for a lot of
15,jobs
15,now what you can expect is to keep
15,applying and you're going to hear
15,from some of them okay and in the next
15,video we'll dive more
15,into what to do in the actual interview
15,process and actually
15,um starting the job but
15,in general i just kind of want to set
15,the framework for what the next video
15,will be about and that's kind of
15,the general overview of the interview
15,so you're likely going to start by
15,talking to somebody in hr
15,you'll then move to what they call the
15,hiring manager that's the person that's
15,actually hiring for this position
15,and then if everything goes well they'll
15,bring you in
15,for an on-site interview or in this case
15,over zoom like a panel interview where
15,you'll interview with multiple people
15,and probably have to give a presentation
15,similar to what you did when you
15,apply for a post-doc and i just want
15,everyone to understand that if this is
15,something that you really want to do
15,keep going don't be discouraged if you
15,get people you know
15,you don't actually hear back from
15,company a that you really wanted to work
15,for
15,or that you uh keep getting rejections
15,you know
15,don't worry about it you'll eventually
15,find a position everybody does
15,it just takes time so with that i'm
15,gonna bring this video to an
15,end if you liked it i hope you could
15,give it a thumbs up and subscribe
15,share it and i'll catch all of you in
15,the next one bye
16,welcome back everyone today we have a
16,really
16,really special episode we just crossed
16,100 subscribers and i cannot thank
16,all of you guys enough when i first
16,started this channel
16,i remember i was just thinking when i
16,started grad school
16,i really didn't have any kind of
16,references like this
16,i kind of went in blind i wasn't
16,completely sure what grad school was
16,about
16,i wasn't sure how to look for a postdoc
16,you know i
16,all of these things were foreign
16,concepts to me and so when i made this
16,channel what i was hoping is that
16,i'm not gonna blow anyone's mind but
16,maybe i could give some real honest
16,feedback about
16,what life is like in grad school and
16,through postdoc and
16,you know after that and help somebody
16,out along the way in one way or another
16,that's really what i wanted from this
16,i was gonna be happy if i had just a few
16,people that actually watched this video
16,but actually getting to a hundred
16,subscribers i didn't think that would
16,ever happen i thought no matter how many
16,videos i put out
16,this is such a niche group of people
16,that would be watching you know people
16,that are going in for a master's for phd
16,in
16,in science it's not this huge you know
16,industry it's not like i'm a tech
16,reviewer so i never thought that i could
16,reach 100 viewers
16,so i really really genuinely want to
16,thank everyone that's
16,subscribed and taken the time to watch
16,any of these videos
16,i really hope that this content has been
16,helpful i know that we've tried to cover
16,things in grad school
16,with post-doc transitioning between the
16,two
16,i'm doing a little bit of a series on
16,transitioning to industry which would be
16,for people that are you know maybe a
16,little bit past grad school but
16,you know maybe there's some people in
16,grad school that think about that they
16,want to do industry they're not really
16,interested in becoming a pi
16,i'm really interested to know what
16,people
16,are interested in seeing so what kinds
16,of videos do you guys want to see
16,please leave a comment down below and
16,let me know and the more comments i get
16,on different topics
16,the more ideas i have of what you guys
16,are interested in you know this channel
16,is for you guys it's not really for me i
16,already did grad school in a postdoc and
16,i'm working in industry now you know
16,this channel is to help you guys and so
16,unless i know what you guys are
16,interested in it's hard to always make a
16,video specifically answering a question
16,that you want
16,so again make sure to leave a comment
16,down below i could see on analytics some
16,of what videos get more likes so i have
16,some ideas about what people are
16,interested in
16,seems people are interested in that
16,transition going from
16,grad school to postdoc those are the
16,videos that tend to do the best but i
16,don't know
16,maybe some people are interested in
16,writing a dissertation or how to write a
16,scientific paper
16,so with that i just want to say thank
16,you guys one more time
16,and have a great rest of your day
17,welcome back everybody today's going to
17,be a bit of a shorter video but i'm
17,going to try to answer
17,two viewer questions and one since
17,they're closely related
17,if you guys have any other questions
17,feel free to leave them in the comments
17,below in this video or any other and i'm
17,happy to answer them either in the
17,comments or sometimes even
17,talk about them in a video i think this
17,is a good way to interact back and forth
17,between
17,between all of us and i think that some
17,of the questions that get asked are
17,things that other people are probably
17,themselves curious about
17,so today what we're going to do is we're
17,going to talk about the process of
17,actually
17,applying for postdoc position this is a
17,little different than grad school right
17,when you do grad school
17,there's a set things you need to do like
17,you need to go on to the department
17,website and fill out their forms and
17,submit your gre
17,and your gpa and transcripts and here
17,it's different you're reaching out to
17,an individual pi that you want to join
17,their lab
17,so there's really two ways that you
17,could go about apply
17,the first way and the one that i don't
17,necessarily recommend although it has
17,worked for others
17,is through job postings so whether it's
17,on a pi's you know website you know
17,their lab has their own
17,dedicated web page through the
17,department webpage
17,through a job board like linkedin or
17,indeed
17,you can go ahead and apply for a
17,position and say
17,you know yes i see your job posting and
17,here's my cv
17,and my cover letter and these are the
17,people i want for letters of
17,recommendation
17,i think personally the better way of
17,doing it is to just
17,think about whose lab do you want to go
17,to there's got to be somebody in the
17,field that you know and you're like i
17,really want to go to their lab or come
17,up with a list
17,talk to your pi hey you know we're
17,getting close to the end here i need to
17,start thinking about labs to go to who
17,do you recommend that i go to and why
17,come up with your list and then what
17,you're going to want to do is email them
17,it doesn't need to be a very in-depth
17,email it could be something as simple as
17,dear doctor and so-and-so my name is
17,so-and-so and i work in
17,so-and-so's lab at blank university
17,i've been studying this and i'm really
17,interested in your lab for these reasons
17,please find attached a cover letter
17,describing
17,more about myself and please find my cv
17,and i look forward to hearing from you
17,and then that's it
17,and you just wait see what they say some
17,of them are going to come back right
17,away and say you know thank you but i
17,really don't have any more room i don't
17,have any more funding
17,some of them are going to come back and
17,say you know something in between
17,you know yes and no and they'll say well
17,you know i'm not really
17,able to take on anyone right now but
17,maybe in a few months i will so stay in
17,touch
17,and some of them are going to come back
17,interested okay can you send me three
17,people that
17,can be a reference for you or let's set
17,up a time to talk
17,on the phone you know that's exactly
17,what you're going to be shooting for
17,but that's pretty much what you need to
17,be doing is you need to be reaching out
17,to them yourself
17,and saying i'm interested in joining
17,your lab the advantages to doing that
17,are that
17,one not every pi is going to be posting
17,on a job board
17,many of the newer pi's that aren't
17,established they kind of have to because
17,they have to be able to get word of
17,mouth out
17,but some of the pis that are more
17,established they don't necessarily need
17,to especially if you're talking about
17,somebody with a big name okay
17,they can just attract any talent that
17,they want they
17,don't need to post on a job board some
17,of them don't have time
17,some of them what's gonna happen is
17,you're gonna catch them before they
17,would even post something
17,so i'll give you this example you have
17,professor a and professor a has four
17,postdocs
17,and one of them is going to be leaving
17,in a few months well they probably
17,haven't posted anything up on a job
17,board yet but they already know
17,that one of their postdocs is about to
17,leave so they already have in mind that
17,they need to replace that
17,so if you email them you know and it
17,happens to be that opportune time
17,they'll say yes i am looking for
17,somebody
17,you know so you can kind of catch them
17,before anything gets posted
17,so that kind of gets to the first
17,question that was asked by a viewer
17,which is
17,what's the best way to do it is it
17,through like a job board or through
17,emailing them one-on-one and i think
17,that directly contacting them is
17,definitely what
17,from my personal experience and from
17,others that i know
17,the best way of doing it now the second
17,question was
17,well i've emailed them and it's been
17,about a week and i haven't heard
17,anything
17,back so what do i do and that's a great
17,question
17,and this kind of comes to time so i
17,would say that after a week i wouldn't
17,be too worried
17,you know don't forget pis are busy they
17,have their own lab that they're running
17,for all you know they're out of town at
17,a conference
17,they'd be taking vacation they could be
17,at study section you know so there's
17,a thousand different reasons why they
17,can be slow to respond and in general i
17,find that academics are just
17,generally slow to respond to email
17,there's just
17,so much going on in their day they are
17,so busy they don't have time
17,to keep up with email and that's fine
17,you just need to be patient
17,i think that after a week and a half you
17,know or
17,something in that time range it's
17,totally okay to send a polite follow-up
17,email and say
17,you know i'm just reminding you that i
17,had sent my cv
17,and i'm really interested in getting to
17,know you and your work
17,more and having a chance to discuss the
17,possibility of joining your lap
17,most times that nudge is enough for them
17,to say oh yeah i totally forgot about
17,that person like i was interested in
17,them
17,i should probably follow up or it's
17,enough for them to say you know sorry i
17,just have been really busy and haven't
17,had a chance to follow up yet
17,i'm really not looking for a new postdoc
17,but either way it's usually enough to
17,nudge them one way or another
17,sometimes pis do get back to you really
17,fast sometimes they're slow
17,the lab that i ended up doing my postdoc
17,in i had sent an
17,email and i want to say it was
17,end of september beginning of october
17,and it was around
17,thanksgiving so like towards the end of
17,november when i actually heard back from
17,her from the first time where she was
17,like oh yeah i'm interested in you
17,joining my lab
17,and by then i i had already started
17,talking to about three other pis about
17,joining their lab and she was really
17,late to the game
17,now it didn't end up mattering because
17,she was by far and away
17,the person i wanted to do my postdoc
17,with and she was the one that i thought
17,was going to be the best
17,fit and best for my career so it didn't
17,end up
17,mattering in the end but just as an
17,example so
17,just because you don't hear from someone
17,for a little bit doesn't necessarily
17,mean that the answer is going to be no
17,now keep in mind there are going to be
17,times where you're going to run into pis
17,that actually just
17,never get back to you and that's fine
17,you know they're lost if you're
17,you know a hard worker you're smart hey
17,you know they're lost that they didn't
17,get back to you so you know don't let
17,that bother you it's
17,totally fine and it happens to all of us
17,so with that i'm gonna wrap this video
17,up again
17,if you like the video hit the thumbs up
17,share it with people that you think
17,could be interested in this kind of
17,content i'm happy to answer viewer
17,questions so continue asking them down
17,below if we could rack up enough we
17,could do like a real q a video where
17,we go through several different
17,questions that people ask and we kind of
17,rapid fire
17,so i really like that kind of content
17,and i think that in general
17,this kind of a channel is going to
17,benefit substantially from that because
17,the
17,questions that each person have
17,generally tends to be the same thing
17,that
17,everybody has these are all questions
17,that i had myself
17,and i'm sure other people have so don't
17,be afraid to ask
17,and i'm happy to make videos about this
17,so with that i'll catch you guys in the
17,next one
17,thanks for watching
18,welcome back everybody before we get
18,going
18,i could tell from the analytics that a
18,lot of you watching haven't yet
18,subscribed
18,so if you like the content that i'm
18,putting out make sure to subscribe
18,like the videos that you think are
18,worthwhile to you
18,make sure to hit the bell if you want to
18,be notified whenever i put out a new
18,video
18,it's really going to help grow the
18,channel and it's going to help us reach
18,more people that are going through that
18,grad school grind
18,so with that let's get started with
18,something that is a viewer question and
18,that is
18,how to write a good and compelling
18,personal statement when you're applying
18,for grad school
18,now this is something that people do not
18,take as seriously as they should
18,so you have things like your gpa and
18,your gre score and those are fine and
18,good
18,but those are kind of more disqualifiers
18,and what do i mean by that
18,is they're going to look and say okay
18,everyone that has
18,less than a 3-5 gpa we're not going to
18,look at and everyone above a 3-5 gpa we
18,will look at
18,now i'm not sure what the actual cutoff
18,is it's going to depend on the school in
18,the program
18,but what i'm trying to get at is
18,somebody with a 3
18,5 versus a 3 6 in this scenario isn't
18,going to make a difference
18,it's just used as a cut off things that
18,are going to make a big difference are
18,things like
18,letters of recommendation personal
18,statement
18,etc so the personal statement is really
18,really
18,important and it's a way for you to set
18,yourself apart
18,and it's a way for them to really get to
18,know who you are
18,so let's get into some of the do's and
18,don'ts of writing a personal statement
18,this is one i don't want to spend too
18,much time on and that is
18,following directions i hope i don't have
18,to go too much into this but
18,follow the directions each place is
18,going to be asking for a different type
18,of personal statement
18,the length of the personal statement may
18,be different there may be open-ended
18,questions
18,versus wanting to know specifics about
18,your research experience
18,whatever it is make sure you follow the
18,directions nothing screams
18,not qualified for grad school like not
18,being able to follow
18,directions so that's one of the most
18,important things
18,and just something i have to mention the
18,next thing that i think is the most
18,important thing is
18,authenticity being authentic
18,you're going to see a lot of people
18,write cliches which are things that you
18,should
18,not be doing in your personal statement
18,so a cliche might be something like
18,i have always loved science it's always
18,been interesting to me
18,i want to pursue a career in science
18,because i love science and i want to be
18,able to help
18,patients and the best way to do that is
18,by doing basic research
18,that is not what you should be writing
18,that is totally cliche and something
18,that they're going to read
18,over and over and over and over again
18,and it does nothing to help you stand
18,out
18,everyone applying to grad school likes
18,science in one way or another
18,everyone applying to grad school in one
18,way or another wants to be able to help
18,patients
18,you're not doing anything to
18,differentiate yourself don't use those
18,kinds of cliches
18,be authentic and the way that you be
18,authentic is by being very specific
18,with examples and with character traits
18,so let's talk about each of them really
18,quick
18,so specific examples would be something
18,like this
18,i was thinking about going into medicine
18,that was what i was interested in and
18,when i was
18,a sophomore in college i began working
18,in a lab
18,i actually really liked it this was the
18,first time i
18,kind of got the experience of doing
18,research
18,and i remember the first time that i
18,went through
18,i got data my experiment worked
18,and it was exactly what we were hoping
18,was going to be happening
18,our hypothesis was right and i remember
18,that
18,feeling inside of
18,wow this is so cool that i
18,solved a new piece of the puzzle and i
18,was the first person to do it i was the
18,first person
18,to learn this piece of information and
18,that feeling was something that
18,i can never replace and even to this day
18,i still get excited about a new piece of
18,data or that feeling of like
18,yes like my experiment worked that's
18,being authentic
18,that's using an example and saying this
18,is why i want to go and pursue a career
18,in science
18,i love that feeling
18,character traits is another way that you
18,could come across as authentic
18,so thinking about some of the other
18,videos that we've put out
18,or just in your own opinion what are
18,different things that would make a
18,successful
18,graduate student okay i'm someone that's
18,really hard working okay you know
18,that is a good one but that's kind of
18,cliche so thinking about something like
18,i have good perseverance i understand
18,that everything i do
18,isn't going to work but i'm someone
18,that's going to continually work
18,to improve on my methodology until it
18,does
18,i'm not somebody that's going to easily
18,give up
18,now that's something that's you know in
18,there what you're doing is you're
18,admitting that
18,yeah not every single thing that i do
18,works but you know what
18,i don't care i'll keep doing it until
18,it's right and i eventually do get it
18,right and that's the important thing
18,because that's what happens in science
18,especially for first year grad
18,students one of the biggest issues with
18,burnout and first year grad
18,students is there are these perfect
18,straight a students that have everything
18,work for them
18,and then they go into the lab and things
18,don't work and they have
18,no idea what to do when that happens so
18,being able to set your
18,self apart and say hey you know what
18,that's me
18,i get it not everything in life is gonna
18,work but i'll find a way to make it work
18,that is going to set yourself apart
18,so what other kinds of things do you
18,need to make sure that you're doing when
18,you're writing your personal statement
18,proofreading especially especially if
18,english is not your second
18,is not your first language you need to
18,make sure that you proofread and that
18,you have
18,others proofread your work especially if
18,you
18,are a native english speaker that's when
18,you really need someone else to
18,proofread your work because it's real
18,easy to fall into the trap of saying
18,well
18,english is my first language and i know
18,what i'm doing well
18,this is something that's going to help
18,determine you know
18,the rest of your career getting into
18,grad school and then what you could do
18,afterwards
18,so treat it as such have your parents
18,have
18,somebody else that's a classmate have a
18,significant other or a friend or
18,somebody
18,you need to have at least one person
18,proofreading
18,talk about potential shortcomings is
18,another
18,so this is your chance where say you had
18,one semester where your grades kind of
18,faltered so overall your gpa was pretty
18,good but you had one semester in there
18,where you didn't do so hot
18,talk about why that is you know my
18,third semester of my junior year my
18,mother died and because of that um
18,you know my gpa wasn't as good that that
18,obviously did not happen to me my mother
18,is
18,still alive and well but as an example
18,you know
18,such and such circumstances happen and
18,that's kind of
18,why i didn't have a stellar semester but
18,then afterwards i did bounce back
18,another thing that you really should do
18,is talk about career goals
18,don't make the mistake of
18,writing your personal statement as if
18,grad school
18,is the end-all be-all and it's the end
18,of the railroad track
18,because it's not what you need to do to
18,set yourself apart is to say
18,my final goal is to start my own lab
18,i want to be a pi you know i've done
18,research i've seen what the life of a pi
18,is kind of like as i've been doing this
18,research and that's the life that i want
18,that's the career that i want i want to
18,be able to dedicate myself
18,fully to science and the means the
18,vehicle to get there
18,is by starting in grad school
18,look at grad school as the beginning not
18,as the end because in a lot of ways it
18,is
18,okay i know that you're finishing your
18,undergrad and you look at it as like you
18,know this is the next big step and i get
18,that
18,but when you look back and a lot of
18,scientists look back and they actually
18,don't tend to look at
18,undergrad as the beginning they tend to
18,look at grad school as the beginning
18,undergrad is just
18,a continuation of high school and you
18,know more learning but your real
18,like hardcore training starts in grad
18,school and they look at it as the
18,beginning
18,so talk about what your career is and
18,how grad school is going to help
18,and even more so talk about how this
18,specific department is going to help
18,you know if you're applying to a
18,genetics department
18,say that you know i have this interest
18,of one day
18,researching sickle cell anemia which
18,there's a genetic component too and so i
18,want to
18,get a deeper understanding of genetics
18,and that's why i'm really interested in
18,joining this department
18,that kind of tying it in specificity
18,it's these are things that not a lot of
18,people are gonna do and when you
18,do it you're going to set yourself apart
18,so i think we already talked about some
18,of the other types of
18,things that you shouldn't be doing um so
18,things like being generic or cliche
18,never good
18,you're not going to stand out
18,i know we talked about being authentic
18,and not coming off as maybe like a robot
18,but don't be too laxed okay
18,so if you send text messages and you
18,write the letter u instead of writing y
18,o u don't do that don't write hahaha
18,in your personal statement you don't
18,want to be too lacks do you still need
18,to come off as being professional
18,um make sure that you avoid potentially
18,uh controversial topics you don't want
18,to talk about religion
18,you don't want to talk about politics
18,you don't want to talk about personal
18,beliefs that are things that
18,can be seen as controversial okay
18,you don't know who's gonna be reading
18,your personal statement it's gonna
18,typically be more than one person and
18,you don't know what their religion is or
18,what their beliefs are
18,so stay away from that kind of stuff
18,so i think these are a good place to
18,start in terms of the do's and don'ts
18,i really hope that you find this video
18,helpful you know remember at the end
18,this is your first way to set yourself
18,apart from the pack
18,make it specific to you make it
18,authentic
18,come off as a genuine person it's real
18,easy to tell in writing when somebody's
18,being genuine or not
18,take the extra time to have somebody
18,proofread your work
18,ask them questions as they're reading it
18,does this sound like me an accurate
18,reflection
18,you know these are the things that i
18,think are going to go a long way
18,so with that i want to thank everyone
18,again for watching again
18,don't forget to subscribe i know a lot
18,of you aren't subscribed that are
18,watching
18,please do it's going to help keep
18,growing the channel and getting to
18,more folks so we can help them out with
18,their grad school grind
18,and moving on through their postdoc and
18,such with that
18,catch you guys in the next one bye
19,welcome back everybody today we're gonna
19,be doing part three of our three-part
19,series and transitioning to industry
19,if you haven't caught parts one and two
19,make sure to go back and check those out
19,the first part is all about the
19,differences between life and industry
19,and academia
19,and the second part is all about the
19,interview process
19,today what i want to focus on is my
19,personal thoughts and feelings as i
19,started transitioning into industry and
19,how i
19,felt uh compared to what life was like
19,in academia
19,now keep in mind that this is of course
19,just my personal experience it's not
19,going to reflect what everybody went
19,through
19,and it certainly isn't going to be
19,reflective of everything that happens
19,when you transition to industry because
19,when i transitioned it was during the
19,coven 19 pandemic
19,so you know just like everything else in
19,the world it wasn't quite the same as
19,what you would normally see
19,so with that let's you know let's get
19,into it so
19,when i transition to industry i remember
19,being
19,totally totally excited and
19,nervous and overwhelmed and just
19,all the emotions tied into one so
19,let's start with the excitement part
19,right so this whole time we
19,kind of go through undergrad and grad
19,school and postdoc
19,and we see all of our friends going out
19,and they're starting to get jobs right
19,maybe they're an accountant or they're a
19,teacher
19,you know whatever it is that they do
19,they found their forever
19,career path and for us it's a little
19,different right
19,i remember thinking to myself like what
19,am i actually gonna be when i'm older
19,like
19,is it gonna be that i'm a pi am i gonna
19,be a scientist
19,am i gonna be like a c-level exact
19,somewhere like
19,what am i actually gonna be and to
19,finally be able to say
19,yeah i'm a scientist like this is what
19,i'm doing i'm a scientist in industry
19,it was an exciting feeling to finally
19,finally get that
19,a lot of other reasons to be excited too
19,don't get me wrong that's not the only
19,one
19,so for example you're gonna make a lot
19,more money that's nice like
19,you're not a broke postdoc anymore
19,you're making more money
19,you get to try something new i know that
19,for a long
19,time you're stuck in this like almost
19,like rut you kind of feel like in in
19,academics and that's not to say that
19,there's nothing
19,wrong with being in academics but when
19,you're there day after day
19,grinding away as a postdoc you start
19,feeling a little bit like you're in a
19,rut
19,and being able to say that i'm gonna
19,start something fresh like it just feels
19,nice
19,you get all kinds of new glitter and
19,glamour
19,so you get you know a new computer for
19,work
19,you're gonna get to work in a nice
19,office space
19,and your own nice desk and you know you
19,get these little perks and it just
19,it makes you excited at the same time
19,though you feel a little nervous
19,right so you're really stepping outside
19,your comfort zone so you may have
19,stepped outside of your
19,comfort zone when you went to grad
19,school certainly it's a change from
19,undergrad
19,you know depending on how much you
19,changed your direction of research you
19,stepped out of your comfort zone going
19,from
19,grad school to a postdoc but going into
19,industry like that's different that's
19,something that you
19,you know people could tell you what
19,going into industry is like
19,but it's one of those things that until
19,you do it and you're there for a little
19,bit
19,you really don't know what it's like
19,compared to being in academics and there
19,is a big difference
19,they're they're similar in in a few ways
19,but there
19,is a substantial difference in the way
19,that your day-to-day works and
19,what the expectations of you are
19,and there's ways that you could amplify
19,this kind of nervousness if you will
19,or anxiety so for example when i was
19,starting
19,i was being put in charge of a whole
19,team now not every scientist when they
19,start is going to be in charge of a
19,whole team
19,but if you are or even if you're just
19,managing one person
19,right your whole career so far has been
19,about yourself and managing your own
19,projects
19,and now you're going to be asked to do
19,that and to manage other people
19,you know you've never done that before
19,you don't have experience managing
19,let alone like have any experience to
19,understand what
19,you know industry is like you know now
19,that i've been there for a while like
19,yes i can manage my team like i
19,understand what the expectations of my
19,team are and what the
19,where we fit in with the company and and
19,what we do but when you first start like
19,you don't really know so how are you
19,supposed to manage someone when you
19,haven't had experience
19,managing and you don't really understand
19,what you're supposed to be doing
19,yourself
19,it's a little nerve-wracking
19,and then there's a a real big feeling of
19,being overwhelmed right
19,so when you start there's a lot of
19,things thrown at you
19,really really fast you know you do your
19,typical training and onboarding and
19,orientation you know the things you have
19,to do when you start anywhere that
19,you're going to work
19,but one of the big differences that i
19,think people kind of gloss over
19,between academics and industry is the
19,expectation
19,in terms of turnover and how fast you're
19,actually getting things done
19,like your efficiency at work so in your
19,postdoc
19,if experiments don't work okay that's
19,fine you're not holding up anyone but
19,yourself
19,but in industry you work close with
19,everybody
19,around you and if you slow down you slow
19,down
19,everybody and the whole pipeline of the
19,company starts coming to a halt because
19,you're slowing down
19,and that's not a good look so there's an
19,expectation
19,from your managers that you're actually
19,churning out data
19,quickly and that you're picking up on
19,new experiments
19,quickly and that you're learning your
19,way around and
19,how you do all your experiments quickly
19,okay
19,so there's this kind of overwhelming
19,feeling that you get as you go where
19,you know unlike in academics you really
19,need to catch on
19,quick quick quick and it's rapid fire um
19,the other thing is you kind of start
19,getting overwhelmed with all the
19,meetings you know you're not used to
19,that
19,and all of a sudden you're expected to
19,be in meeting after meeting after
19,meeting and understand what this
19,person's talking about here
19,what that person's talking about there
19,each meetings with totally different
19,people you've never met before and you
19,have no idea what they're talking about
19,and you kind of end the day feeling like
19,wow i have no clue
19,what in the world is going on i have no
19,clue
19,what in the world is going on in my
19,position or what i'm supposed to be
19,doing
19,um but despite all of that i think that
19,it's really exciting and that if you do
19,make this transition into industry
19,you need to treat it as exciting this is
19,a your first time doing it and there's
19,only one time in your life you're gonna
19,do it for the first time
19,you know later when you transition to
19,industry
19,you know you've done it before you're
19,gonna move from one company to another
19,so it's not really like a transition
19,into industry it would be more like
19,between companies
19,but this is like a first year grad
19,student right like
19,this is your first time like going and
19,doing your own research and if you can
19,remember what that feels like it's a
19,very cool
19,feeling and you should it's the same
19,thing when you start an industry
19,you should really try to remember all of
19,those moments because this is a real
19,special time in your life that you're
19,kind of changing direction
19,you're starting your first real career
19,position outside of doing a post-doc
19,you're establishing yourself as a
19,scientist it's sort of
19,the culmination of everything that
19,you've learned through
19,undergrad grad school post-doc all kind
19,of coming together
19,and you know enjoy it because this is
19,the one time you're gonna get to do it
19,i know that this is kind of a little bit
19,shorter of a video than some of the
19,other videos we've done recently
19,but i kind of wanted to wrap up this
19,three-part series uh i'm talking about
19,going into industry
19,so if you want to know more about
19,industry you know leave a comment down
19,below and i'm happy to make more videos
19,about that
19,uh otherwise you know we may just stick
19,towards things related to grad school on
19,the postdoc that's what this channel was
19,originally designed for but
19,you know i wanted to kind of put this
19,out there because not everybody
19,wants to be a pi some people want to go
19,to industry so i thought maybe we need
19,some content for those folks as well
19,so with that i'm gonna sign off i hope
19,you guys all have a wonderful day
19,evening wherever you are and i'll catch
19,you in the next one
19,bye
20,welcome back everybody so today's going
20,to be a little bit different of a video
20,as you could tell we're looking at my
20,mac screen instead of looking at me and
20,that's because we're going to be going
20,over
20,how to write a postdoc cover letter this
20,was something that was requested in the
20,comments section and i thought this was
20,a great choice for a video
20,so if you have any video ideas that you
20,would like to see
20,you know make sure to leave a comment
20,down below and i think we could get to
20,those
20,if you really like this type of video
20,where we're going through things on a
20,computer rather than just hearing me
20,talk about something
20,make sure to hit the thumbs up button
20,it'll help the
20,youtube algorithm will be able to get
20,this video to more people it'll let me
20,know that this is some kind of
20,content that you really like to see so
20,in this video we're going to be a
20,pretend grad
20,student named jim and we're going to be
20,writing a cover letter to dr
20,john smith trying to get into their lab
20,now
20,these are just made up people they're
20,fictitious this has nothing to do with
20,my
20,personal experience but you know let's
20,go through these and these are going to
20,range from really bad to what i think is
20,a pretty good cover letter
20,and i'm going to point out things that i
20,think are good and bad about each of
20,these so
20,with that let's get into the first
20,example which says hey john
20,i just wanted to say i want to join your
20,lab
20,check out my cv and get back to me lol
20,gym okay right off the bat this one
20,should come off as a really bad one to
20,anyone watching this
20,okay first of all you're not buddies
20,with anyone that you're applying to
20,be a postdoc in their lab so it
20,shouldn't be hey john
20,it should be dear in this case dr smith
20,or dear doctor whoever
20,if you are on a first name basis with
20,anybody
20,that you're applying to their lab your
20,cover letter is probably going to be a
20,little bit different
20,so there were a couple of people
20,actually in my day that i
20,applied to their lab and actually was on
20,a first name basis with them
20,one was on my committee for a
20,graduate level grant and i got to know
20,her over
20,a couple of years and another was a
20,pi that i met at a conference and hit it
20,off and we talked for quite a while and
20,he ended up
20,doing some collaboration with the pi who
20,was my thesis advisor
20,and i got to know him on a first name
20,basis as well and so those are a little
20,bit different scenarios but in general
20,what we're going to be assuming are
20,these
20,are people you really aren't on a first
20,name basis so
20,using a first name really isn't
20,appropriate
20,i just wanted to say i want to join your
20,lab okay you know that's
20,good we should be you know pointing out
20,exactly what we're looking for i think
20,this sentence could be worded better and
20,this goes into some things we've talked
20,about before with
20,you need to always be proof reading your
20,your
20,letters your cv all of that personal
20,statements
20,so it could be worded better but overall
20,it gets the a point across
20,check out my cv and get back to me lol
20,we should be more professional than that
20,we shouldn't be using lol
20,so with that you know this is probably
20,not a good one
20,let's move on to some other examples
20,that we have here
20,example number two dear dr smith all
20,right so
20,here we've already bumped it up a little
20,bit we're not just saying
20,hey john we're saying dear dr smith
20,i'm about to graduate from harvard
20,university with a 4.0 gpa
20,i've published one paper and i'm now
20,looking for a postdoc position
20,attached is my cv for you to assess my
20,strengths
20,i look forward to hearing from you
20,regards jim
20,all right this is a much better one so
20,of course like i said we start off with
20,dear dr smith
20,i am about to graduate from harvard with
20,a 4.0 gpa
20,good you're saying what you've been
20,doing and that you have a good gpa
20,i've published one paper and i'm now
20,looking for a postdoc position okay so
20,you've published something in grad
20,school that's good
20,attaches my cv for you to assess my
20,strengths okay it's good you're letting
20,them know that
20,you know my cv is attached i hope that
20,you think that it's good and i look
20,forward to hearing from you regards jim
20,um overall this is a pretty decent start
20,to a cover letter
20,i think the biggest thing that's missing
20,from this is some level of specificity
20,so you say that you went to harvard and
20,you have a 4.0 gpa which is good but
20,you know what did you study what
20,department in harvard were you went
20,and it's not very specific in terms of
20,the pi that you're trying to apply to
20,their lab either so
20,this is something that you could just
20,mass send out and just change out
20,dr smith for doctor whoever it doesn't
20,really
20,say anything about you in terms of you
20,got to know this
20,specific person and there's a reason
20,that you want to join their lab
20,and in fact when you see these kinds of
20,cover letters most of the pis are going
20,to assume that you're spam sending out
20,cvs to every single pi that's listed
20,under the
20,under the sun so you want to be able to
20,tailor it to each specific person
20,that's something to keep in mind example
20,number three
20,dear dr smith my name is jim
20,and i'm about to graduate from harvard
20,university's genetics department and i'm
20,now looking for a postdoc position
20,all right so this is already better than
20,the last one we're saying
20,you know my name is jim so you're
20,introducing yourself you're saying that
20,you're graduating from harvard and from
20,the genetics department and you're
20,starting to look for a postdoc position
20,okay this one's already much
20,clearer and to the point as to you know
20,this is who i am i'm graduating from
20,this specific department
20,and i'm starting to look for a postdoc
20,position
20,i think i would be a great fit for your
20,lab since i had a 4.0 gpa and have
20,published one paper
20,okay so you're saying that you think you
20,would be a good fit for the lab this is
20,another step up and that you're saying
20,like
20,hey i think i would be a good fit for
20,your lab i think the one thing missing
20,from this one is that
20,you know gpa isn't really going to be a
20,good determinant
20,of if you're going to be a good fit for
20,the lab or not but you're at least
20,moving in the right direction here
20,please find my cv and i look forward to
20,hearing from you okay so
20,overall this one's a little bit better
20,than the last one and if your
20,cover letter looked like this you'd
20,probably be in decent shape it's not
20,the best cover letter in the world it's
20,not gonna blow anyone's socks off but
20,it's not bad okay um you know
20,what i think we're gonna do now is go
20,through the last example which is one
20,that i wrote and of course this is all
20,fictitious this isn't anything about
20,what i studied
20,at all but i think this would be an
20,example of a good
20,cover letter and kind of what you should
20,be striving for
20,dear dr smith my name is jim and i am a
20,senior graduate student at harvard
20,university's genetics department
20,i came across your impressive work on
20,map k
20,signaling when i was doing an extensive
20,literature
20,search for my dissertation on map
20,kinase's role in colon cancer
20,since then i have read several papers
20,from your laboratory and i believe
20,i could greatly benefit from pursuing
20,post-doctoral research with you
20,and advance my knowledge in cell
20,signaling i am dedicated to moving my
20,career forward and would be a valuable
20,asset to your lab
20,since i have a unique perspective coming
20,from an oncology background
20,please find attached to my cv i would
20,greatly enjoy the opportunity to talk
20,with you about my current research and
20,learn
20,more about the fascinating work coming
20,out of your lab i look forward to
20,hearing from you
20,regards jim okay so this is basically
20,the gold standard of what we should be
20,going for
20,now i'm sure there's a thousand
20,different ways that we could come up
20,with different scenarios in terms of
20,like
20,what a good cover letter would look for
20,so in this particular instance i used it
20,where
20,you know jim came across dr smith when
20,he was reading through literature you
20,know he was doing a literature
20,search but it could have just as easily
20,been i
20,heard you at a conference and thought
20,that your talk was so interesting i went
20,back and read more of your literature
20,and
20,you know it blew my mind or i'm looking
20,to join
20,in this field and i know that you're the
20,leading researcher in this field and so
20,i've read through your papers and i
20,thought that the research was great you
20,know it could be a bunch of different
20,things but
20,let's talk about what i think makes this
20,particular cover letter really stand out
20,and
20,and works really well my name is jim i'm
20,a senior graduate
20,student at harvard's genetics department
20,okay i came across your impressive work
20,on map case signaling
20,when i was doing an extensive literature
20,search for my dissertation on map
20,kinase's role in colon cancer so right
20,here what you're doing is you're saying
20,okay i'm studying colon cancer i
20,understand that you do map k
20,signaling and when i was doing a
20,literature search for my dissertation i
20,came across your work
20,so what you've established is that
20,you've read some of his work
20,that you yourself are familiar with map
20,kinase which is what he works on
20,and you've established what you do
20,research on which is colon cancer
20,since then i have read several papers
20,from your laboratory and i believe i
20,could
20,greatly benefit from pursuing
20,post-doctoral research with
20,you and advancing my knowledge in cell
20,signaling right so
20,mac map kinase is involved in cell
20,signaling
20,and what you're saying is that you think
20,by going to his lab
20,you can further your knowledge in cell
20,signaling now this is really important
20,when you're finishing graduate school
20,you got to remember that you're kind of
20,like at the bottom right
20,graduate school is the bottom you're not
20,at the top
20,and so what you're doing is you're
20,setting yourself up saying that i
20,understand i have
20,more to learn and what i think is in my
20,career direction
20,i want to learn more in this particular
20,area and i think training in this
20,particular area in this case it's cell
20,signaling
20,is really going to boost my chances of
20,success later on
20,i'm dedicated to moving my career
20,forward and would be a
20,valuable asset to your lab since i have
20,a unique perspective
20,coming from an oncology background now
20,this is something that could be fleshed
20,out in real life if there was something
20,so let's pretend in this
20,scenario that dr smith has nobody in his
20,lab that has
20,uh an oncology background well map
20,kinase is important in oncology and so
20,because i have this oncology background
20,i could bring some unique perspective to
20,your lab so it's not just that
20,you know you are going to be training me
20,and i get all the benefit
20,okay i could bring new techniques and
20,ideas to your lab
20,which can enhance the research coming
20,out of your lab
20,please find attached my cv i would
20,greatly enjoy the opportunity to talk to
20,you
20,about my current research and learn more
20,about the fascinating research coming
20,out of your lab okay so this is really
20,good it's basically setting yourself up
20,again
20,it's not just oh i'm gonna wait for you
20,it's hey
20,let's talk i want to learn more about
20,the research you do and i think
20,you on the other hand would like to
20,learn about the research i do
20,okay i look forward to hearing from you
20,even just this little exclamation mark
20,here just kind of
20,shows enthusiasm okay it's really
20,important to try to come
20,across as enthusiastic regards jim
20,so i think this is the gold standard of
20,what we should be shooting for and again
20,there's probably ways that we could make
20,this even better
20,but i think that this is you know really
20,gets across the key points that
20,we're being professional in our writing
20,that we're
20,um acknowledging how we know this
20,particular individual
20,so it's not just spam emailing to
20,everybody
20,that we understand that we have things
20,that we could learn and that we want to
20,learn those things in this person's
20,particular lab
20,you know they like the idea of being
20,able to mold your mind so
20,leave that out there that you think that
20,you have value
20,that you could bring to their lab that
20,it's not just you know you receiving the
20,training that you know techniques or
20,you know some kind of computer
20,programming or whatever it is
20,that you think you could be bringing to
20,that individual's lab that's going to
20,actually
20,benefit them okay and that you're really
20,excited to talk
20,more about research not just the
20,research they're doing but about your
20,research hey
20,i'm doing cool research and i really
20,want to share that with you i think
20,you're going to find it exciting
20,all right this is exactly what i think
20,needs to be done in a cover letter and i
20,think that if
20,i was a pi and i received a cover letter
20,like this i would definitely be opening
20,up their cv and taking a look at what
20,they have
20,okay you know if you're getting some of
20,these other cover letters maybe it's a
20,coin flip
20,you know depends on the day but
20,something like this
20,yeah i know this person's really
20,honestly interested in
20,joining my lab and i don't have to worry
20,about are they just spamming every pi
20,out there
20,so you know guys with that we're gonna
20,wrap it up because it's already starting
20,to become a long video
20,if you like this type of video again
20,make sure to like
20,so i understand that this is the kind of
20,content that you want to see
20,i'd be happy to do things like going
20,over presentations or
20,posters or something like that um
20,illustrator
20,whatever it is but this is a different
20,kind of video i thought we'd give it a
20,try
20,so with that i'm gonna say goodbye and
20,i'll catch you guys in the next one
21,welcome back everybody today we have a
21,really important video that i think is
21,a little bit of an understated area that
21,needs more focus
21,and that is how to actually interview
21,the pi
21,that you're going to want to work for
21,and just like any job out there on the
21,market
21,an interview process is a two-way thing
21,all right you're trying to find a good
21,match so obviously they're interviewing
21,you
21,to come join the lab but you need to
21,interview them and make sure that
21,you know they're a good fit for what you
21,want in your career development
21,i think that when i talk to people that
21,really didn't have a good time in their
21,postdoc there's a few threads that i've
21,noticed and i think that some of these
21,questions would address that
21,some of these are things that i
21,personally asked when i
21,interviewed for a post acquisition and
21,some of them are ones i wish i did and i
21,never even
21,thought of these so i'm hoping that if
21,you could think of some of these and
21,incorporate them into your interview
21,process when you're trying to find a
21,postdoc position
21,maybe it'll help you to find a better
21,fit so with that
21,let's dive into these i have five
21,different questions that i think are
21,really important for you to answer
21,so stick around and watch all of them if
21,you like the content make sure to give
21,it a thumbs up
21,let's keep growing this channel i'm
21,really excited i know that we have some
21,good videos planned in the future
21,so let's dive in the first thing you're
21,going to want to know is about the
21,projects
21,now i'm going under the assumption that
21,if you're applying to somebody's
21,particular lab you have an idea of what
21,that person's actually studying so
21,they may study liver metabolism and
21,within liver metabolism there may be
21,genetics that they study there may be a
21,physiology component you know there's
21,different areas but they study within
21,liver physiology
21,it's important for you to understand
21,what are the potential projects that
21,they're working at so i think one thing
21,that you may want to ask is
21,what are the types of projects that you
21,think i would be working on
21,you could also get some of this if you
21,go on to grant finders like so for
21,example on nih you could pull up
21,people's currently funded projects that
21,may give some insight but
21,the best way is to directly ask them hey
21,what kind of projects do you want me to
21,work on
21,and follow-up questions to that are
21,things like
21,how long has this project been ongoing
21,how many post-docs or grad students have
21,worked on this project
21,because one thing is that people they
21,miss this is that
21,a pi may have a project that they really
21,like and this happened to me
21,there was a project that my pi really
21,liked and i ended up working on it and
21,kind of inheriting it when i came to the
21,lab
21,but this was a project that had been
21,going on for like 10 years and there was
21,multiple uh postdocs that had worked on
21,it and it just
21,it kind of was all over the place and
21,you know it ended up coming together as
21,a good story in the end
21,but there was a lot of this like back
21,and forth if you will
21,so understanding who has worked on this
21,project
21,for how long with what kind of success
21,this is an important thing to know and
21,also is going to let you kind of gauge
21,like
21,is this something i really want to be
21,spending the next three four
21,five years doing okay because if they're
21,telling you you're going to be working
21,on a b and c
21,and you really don't like any of those
21,it's probably not going to be a good fit
21,at the same time you could also get a
21,feel for how many of these projects are
21,ones that are already established in the
21,lab
21,versus how much flexibility are you
21,going to have
21,to start trying to work on things that
21,you want to work on and this is going to
21,be a constant give and take with your pi
21,and everyone's going to have a different
21,way that they want to do this with their
21,post docs but it's important to know if
21,you want to be able to design some of
21,your own projects how much flexibility
21,you have in there
21,the next thing you're going to want to
21,know about is funding and funding goes
21,two ways one
21,what is their current funding situation
21,and two what are their expectations of
21,you
21,okay so the first one is obviously how
21,well-funded are you do you have a spot
21,for me
21,on your r01 if you do how long is that
21,going to last for
21,and how long can you guarantee funding
21,for me okay so if the lab is going to
21,come out and say well yeah we could put
21,you on our r01 and we could fund you but
21,it's only for about a year maybe a year
21,and a half
21,and then from there we don't have
21,guaranteed funding okay that is a lab
21,you want to stay away from
21,that means you do not have a secure
21,future and you're gonna go there and
21,there's a
21,you know a coin flip basically of
21,whether or not after a year
21,you're gonna have a position left and
21,they could even pay you
21,that's you know really not good the
21,other you know
21,side of this coin is you need to know
21,what their expectation is of you
21,okay do they expect that you're going to
21,be getting your own funding
21,if they do expect it what happens if you
21,don't get your own funding
21,are they going to be able to support you
21,are they going to tell you that they
21,want you to find funding within a year
21,or two
21,and if you don't they're going to ask
21,you to leave what are their actual
21,expectations for you
21,and on top of expectations for funding
21,the third question
21,you know kind of builds on this is in
21,general what are your expectations for
21,your postdocs
21,okay is it that three years and i want a
21,paper is it that i expect them to pay
21,publish in nature or sell science is it
21,that i expect them to
21,be in the lab for 40 hours a week 60
21,hours 80
21,hours is it that i expect you to go to
21,at least one conference a year you know
21,what are your expectations
21,of your post docs that's a really
21,important thing to know because that's
21,gonna
21,really give you the most insight into
21,what life is like
21,working in that lab
21,the next thing that you really need to
21,be able to ask is about
21,what has happened with past lab members
21,so
21,say that you want to be a pi that is
21,your end goal you want to
21,finish grad school and now you're going
21,to join this lab to be a post-doc and
21,then later you want to go on
21,and start your own lab it is totally
21,fair
21,and a reasonable question to say my goal
21,is to eventually be a pi can you talk to
21,me about
21,any past lab members from your lab
21,that did their postdoc with you that are
21,now a faculty member or where
21,are the current or where are the past
21,postdocs from your lab what are they
21,doing now okay and that's fair to know
21,you know if you want to be a pi you want
21,to be going to a lab where the pi can
21,turn around and say yeah
21,you know i had at least one person that
21,came in
21,they had a successful time in my lab and
21,now they've established their own lab
21,you know that's good that shows that
21,there's a track record there of
21,you know postdocs coming in and being
21,successful to publish and secure funding
21,and then go on and start their own lab
21,you don't want to go into a lab where
21,you know they can't tell you much about
21,what their former
21,former postdocs have been doing they're
21,kind of in these shoddy
21,positions they're not in a good position
21,that's not really going to help you and
21,you want to make sure that you get
21,yourself into a much better position
21,so really dig in there and find out what
21,have those past
21,postdocs been doing
21,and this is the key one this is the
21,fifth point and i think the
21,actually the most important so for those
21,of you that stuck around to the end
21,you're going to get the best one
21,ask if you could get contact information
21,to any of their current postdocs
21,this is something that i actually kind
21,of lucked into
21,with one of the labs that i interviewed
21,at and i'm really glad that i did
21,because it completely swayed my decision
21,and where to go ask if you could do this
21,if they say no that is a really bad sign
21,that means either a they're really not
21,interested in you or b
21,they're trying to cover up something
21,about their own lab they should be
21,open and honest and feel comfortable
21,with the people
21,that work for them opening up to you
21,about what it's like to work there
21,okay so the lab i ended up going to i
21,actually asked you know can i have
21,so-and-so's contact information i
21,interviewed with them and i really got
21,along
21,before i make any kind of decision i
21,want to be able to talk to them
21,and i ended up sending some text
21,messages back and forth with them
21,and found out a lot about working with
21,this pi and ended up
21,falling in love with the lab even more
21,and it really just kind of
21,sealed the deal for me i was on the
21,fence about going to her lab or another
21,lab and
21,you know this kind of hearing just how
21,wonderful
21,it was and what the environment was like
21,i just
21,it just made me fall in love and made me
21,want to go to her lap and so i ended up
21,you know wanting to go to her lab and
21,when she gave an offer i was like yes i
21,would gladly
21,come over to your lab so i think this is
21,a really important point
21,make sure to get contact information for
21,their current
21,postdocs so with that i think we're
21,gonna wrap it up
21,if you have any questions related to
21,this you know don't forget to leave them
21,in the comments if there's any other
21,videos you want to see leave them in the
21,comments
21,i've been pretty good at trying to
21,incorporate
21,questions that viewers have into videos
21,of their own especially when they could
21,be a stand-alone video or like compiled
21,into one because they kind of fit
21,together i really like doing that i
21,think it's interactive i think it's
21,gonna give you guys
21,the the best way to learn um is by
21,answering your questions because
21,whatever questions you have likely other
21,people have the same question
21,so with that i'll catch you guys in the
21,next one bye
22,welcome back everybody so today we're
22,gonna get to a video that i was planning
22,for the future but someone asked about
22,it in the comments
22,so i think now's about a good time as
22,any to get into it and that is
22,why did i leave a career in academia and
22,go into industry
22,for those of you that have been around
22,for a while at some of my earlier videos
22,i talked about wanting to pursue a
22,career in academics and now some of my
22,later videos have talked about my
22,transition into industry
22,so why did i make that jump this isn't
22,so much of a
22,you know advice video as it is just
22,opening up you know
22,never thought i would be talking about
22,this on the internet but here we are
22,let's discuss kind of you know the three
22,big reasons why i decided to move out of
22,academia and into industry
22,so to understand my move we have to go
22,all the way back to grad
22,school where i was finishing up and
22,looking for a postdoc position and at
22,this point i was coming out of a really
22,big name
22,lab i was really really fortunate to
22,land in this lab
22,things worked out great i had published
22,really exceptionally well and i had
22,built up
22,quite a good cv for a grad student and
22,at the time i thought
22,you know the pinnacle of what i want to
22,do is to be a pi just like this and you
22,know
22,i'm sure that most of you that are in
22,grad school have had the same experience
22,where people have almost looked at
22,industry as this like
22,lesser than thing than if you were to
22,stay in academics
22,and i wanted to make my pi proud i
22,wanted to you know stick with my
22,original goal of
22,going into indus i'm sorry into
22,academics
22,and so when i looked for labs i was
22,specifically looking for labs that i
22,thought was going to set me up
22,for a career in academia and the lab
22,that i chose was at harvard specifically
22,because
22,one the pi was excellent so that's
22,covered
22,two i think it's good when you're trying
22,to go into academia to be doing a
22,postdoc
22,at a larger school right so if you do a
22,post soccer at tier one school
22,it'll set you up to do a pi position at
22,a tier two school whereas if you're
22,doing
22,your postdoc at a tier two school it'll
22,set you up more for a tier three school
22,and it's not necessarily always like
22,that you know that's not a hundred
22,percent of the time of course but
22,in general i think that the institute
22,you do your postdoc at does actually
22,make a difference if you want to go into
22,academia
22,so i had found a great lab i was at
22,harvard
22,this pi really had a reputation of
22,having students that
22,had really good funding they had really
22,good publications
22,they had gone around the world to find
22,you know academic positions and
22,and so i went into that lab starting
22,with all of the
22,expectation that that's exactly what i
22,was going to be doing was that i was
22,going to go ahead
22,and i was going to start you know my
22,career basically
22,and what ended up happening was a few
22,things changed
22,so the first thing that changed was me
22,looking at the landscape of finding a
22,position as a pi
22,so there was a postdoc that was in my
22,lab that was
22,much more senior than me by the time i
22,joined the lab he had actually been
22,promoted up to a junior faculty member
22,and he's a rock star i mean this guy
22,like
22,i'm sure everyone knows someone like
22,this like when they know science like
22,they know science like they know
22,everything not just about their project
22,but they seem to know everything
22,chemistry biology physiology like they
22,just
22,understand how everything works this guy
22,had
22,papers i mean he had you know a couple
22,lower impact papers but he had those
22,like
22,really high cell nature science
22,publications
22,he had a ton of co-authorships even in
22,some of these higher journals
22,he had grants from training grants to
22,fellowships
22,to um you know early career development
22,awards
22,he had everything that you could ask for
22,i mean he was like
22,the ideal role model and i totally
22,looked up to this guy and felt yeah i
22,want to emulate exactly what he's doing
22,because he's doing something right
22,and as i've been there i realized he
22,really has a hard time finding a job
22,in fact he still hasn't found the
22,academic job he's been looking for
22,and it's not just him i knew
22,several people that were you know in big
22,name labs at harvard
22,that did everything right they had the
22,papers they had the experience they had
22,the grants and they just either couldn't
22,find a job
22,or the jobs that they found were just
22,ones that they didn't really want
22,and that kind of spooked me a little bit
22,thinking to myself that
22,the landscape is such that to find a
22,faculty position
22,it's so hard you know do i really want
22,to spend
22,five or six or seven years doing a
22,postdoc only to end up in industry
22,anyways
22,you know that was one of the realistic
22,things for me
22,the second thing that happened was more
22,of me wanting to branch out and do more
22,i had felt that i'd gotten to the point
22,in academia where i had reached the top
22,of what i wanted to do
22,that i learned the ins and outs of you
22,know some of the basics of science
22,writing papers writing grants i had done
22,all that
22,and i wanted to change first of all i
22,didn't want to write grants for my whole
22,career that's certainly not what i
22,wanted to do
22,but i definitely wanted to go ahead and
22,start looking into something else
22,and trying to branch out learn something
22,new experience
22,new things my wife works in industry and
22,i i was kind of envious of her you know
22,she
22,made good money she was doing new and
22,exciting things she was working on drugs
22,that are actually gonna make their way
22,into people
22,um and that was a big catalyst for me to
22,say you know what
22,i've already gotten what i want out of
22,academia i want to try something new i
22,want to try something challenging i kind
22,of want to switch my career
22,and put it on a new trajectory learn new
22,things
22,the last thing that happened was a
22,little bit of money
22,so for those of you that have ever been
22,around the boston area or are familiar
22,with the boston area
22,it is expensive and having a family and
22,a kid in boston is
22,really expensive and what ended up
22,happening was sort of having to make
22,that decision that okay
22,you know to keep this train moving we
22,need to start bringing in more money
22,that a postdoc just isn't going to bring
22,in and we were years away from me
22,you know potentially being able to
22,actually get a faculty position
22,and so the you know part of the decision
22,was just needing to bring in more money
22,um you know that's just part of the
22,truth um it's not the
22,most glamorous answer i know and you
22,know more about wanting to
22,find a new path is one of the larger
22,parts of it but i think that it would be
22,dishonest to say that
22,money didn't play any kind of an issue
22,um you know
22,you don't want to sell out your yourself
22,or your dreams but at the same time
22,you need to make money to be able to
22,support your family and so
22,you know that was one of the things that
22,happened so
22,i know this is a different kind of video
22,this is more me opening up about my own
22,experiences
22,you know of course as always if you like
22,this kind of video hit the thumbs up
22,button down below
22,it'll let me know that this is the kind
22,of videos that you guys like seeing
22,uh put out it'll help that youtube
22,algorithm to help
22,you know promote this video to more
22,viewers so we could keep growing the
22,channel and helping out
22,others if you have any questions about
22,this specific video or there's any other
22,kinds of videos you want to see make
22,sure to comment down below
22,and with that i'll catch you guys in the
22,next one bye
23,welcome back everybody i hope everyone's
23,staying safe and having a good time out
23,there
23,the channel's growing we've crossed that
23,200 subscriber mark we're getting close
23,to our next big milestone which is 250
23,subscribers
23,if you like the content that i'm putting
23,out and you're not yet subscribed make
23,sure to go down below and subscribe
23,once we cross 250 we're going to do a
23,special video
23,i'm going to go back onto the computer
23,and record my screen
23,we're going to take a look at the
23,presentation that i put together for my
23,dissertation
23,and we're going to critique it and roast
23,it together and we're going to talk
23,about all the things that i've learned
23,since grad school and why i think that
23,presentation wasn't very good and how it
23,could be a lot better
23,so make sure to stay tuned for that
23,video but in today's video what we're
23,going to be doing is
23,building off our previous couple videos
23,that we've done about
23,you know moving over into a postdoc
23,position from grad school and the last
23,one that we did was talking about how to
23,actually
23,interview a postdoc pi so if you haven't
23,done that
23,go check out that video because some of
23,the things that we're going to talk
23,about
23,builds off of this and what we're going
23,to be discussing today are the five
23,well actually it's six i'm gonna give a
23,bonus but the five
23,six things that you should be looking
23,for in a postdoc
23,pi that i think are going to make the
23,most successful
23,person for you to train under so with
23,that let's get into today's video
23,so i think the first thing that you need
23,to be looking for and
23,keep in mind this is making sure you
23,know what we're assuming here is that
23,everything is equal right
23,so it's the same level of institute you
23,know one's not
23,at harvard and the other one is at you
23,know some real
23,low level liberal arts school okay
23,everything's equal
23,across what we're talking about we're
23,just really focusing on the pi
23,itself the first thing that you're going
23,to want to do is find someone that's
23,what's called
23,a mid-stage career pi
23,and i'm sure you're going to hear
23,variations of this if you look around
23,youtube or online but what you want is
23,someone that's in the middle of their
23,career
23,so what does that mean and why is that
23,important
23,you don't want somebody too new in their
23,career someone that's
23,just started they haven't established
23,the name for themselves
23,at the same time you don't want someone
23,at the other end of the spectrum someone
23,that's been there for decades and
23,decades and they're done their career is
23,over so i think not wanting somebody new
23,is kind of self-explanatory you don't
23,want someone that doesn't have a name
23,for themselves yet they don't have the
23,connections they don't have a history of
23,having post-docs and grad students move
23,through their lab and
23,successfully transition to future
23,positions
23,the one that's a little less intuitive
23,is why you don't want someone
23,later in their career and really the
23,reason for that is their own personal
23,drive okay
23,i know a lot of pis that are in their
23,later stage of their career and some of
23,them are fantastic in fact
23,my p.i when i defended my dissertation
23,was in his
23,later 70s okay he's still working now in
23,his 80s
23,he's a rock star he's huge in his in his
23,field
23,one of the people that i actually
23,interviewed with for a postdoc position
23,and i worked closely with their lab
23,um during my post-doc he's in his 70s
23,he's a rock star
23,the problem is that these guys they're
23,at the end of their career okay
23,they're not pushing to try to get a full
23,professor
23,they're not pushing to get their tenure
23,they're not pushing to get
23,the next biggest nature paper you know
23,their careers are established their
23,names are established
23,whether you publish in nature or not
23,doesn't matter to them
23,and that's just the sad truth of the
23,matter what you want is that person
23,that's right smack in the middle of
23,their career because
23,that's the person that's working the
23,hardest they're the ones that are trying
23,to get that tenure trying to get that
23,full professorship they're trying to
23,build up their international reputation
23,they're trying to get the next
23,nature paper they're trying to get the
23,next big grant for their
23,lab if you can't tell their drive to
23,succeed
23,is going to help propel you forward in
23,multiple ways
23,so i think that is like one of the key
23,most important things you need to be
23,looking out for
23,the next thing kind of builds off of
23,that and that's
23,the track record of previous post docs
23,so
23,every person is going to be slightly
23,different and your needs are going to be
23,different from person to person but
23,one thing that is certain though is that
23,you want to go to a lab
23,where that pi has a reputation of
23,having post-docs that go into their lab
23,they publish well
23,they're able to get grants and they're
23,able to move on to successful next
23,stages you don't want to go into a lab
23,that you know talented people are going
23,in and it's just a dead end
23,they leave and find another postdoc or
23,they find a menial position that they
23,really weren't looking for you don't
23,want the lab that you go to to be a dead
23,end
23,you want it to be somewhere that you are
23,going to thrive and the best way for you
23,to thrive is to be able to go to a place
23,where others have thrived right so if
23,this you know particular pi has
23,had 10 individuals that now have you
23,know
23,faculty positions at large institutes
23,okay like
23,they know what they're doing they know
23,what it takes in today's day and age to
23,get somebody out the door and into a
23,faculty position if that's you know what
23,you're looking for
23,so that's what you need to be you know
23,keeping in mind
23,the next thing that you need to keep in
23,mind is funding and i don't want to take
23,too long to talk about funding because
23,this is a little bit of a
23,self-explanatory one but i felt it
23,needed to come in here
23,you need to have someone that has
23,funding to keep you in their lab for
23,more than just a year or two
23,okay if they're telling you well
23,you could get your own funding and then
23,after that i should have another grant
23,i wouldn't take that risk you never know
23,when the next grant is going to be
23,coming so you need to make sure they
23,have funding and that they could keep
23,you in their lab
23,for at least three years if they can't
23,do that
23,it is not worth pursuing a postdoc
23,position in their lab
23,okay so number four
23,is going to be about mentorship style
23,this kind of builds into you know each
23,person being a little different so i'm
23,not going to be able to give
23,each person their own advice but i think
23,generally speaking
23,you should by now have some ideas of
23,whether you want
23,a pi that's going to be more hands-on or
23,more hands-off or somewhere in the
23,middle
23,personally what i liked was the style
23,that my pi did
23,she was a little bit more hands-on and
23,involved when you first started in the
23,lab
23,and then as you worked you would gain
23,more independence until
23,you know you basically would check in
23,with with her once a week and say yeah
23,this is what i'm working on and then
23,that was it and she would you know
23,kind of keep you in bounds but really
23,you had free reign to do what you were
23,you know working on some people they
23,need
23,api that's going to be there and really
23,day in and day out be there with them
23,and some really want that flexibility
23,and freedom it's all up to you
23,but keep that in mind where i was doing
23,my postdoc there was a real big name pi
23,um he was fantastic he's a genius
23,and he's won just about every award
23,under the sun
23,however he's a super super hands-off
23,pi and so if you're someone that went
23,into his lab
23,and you didn't know what you were doing
23,you were going to sink
23,fast he just was not going to throw you
23,a lifeline
23,that's just the kind of pi that he was
23,and there's nothing inherently wrong
23,with that
23,but what is wrong is not knowing what
23,you need when you're matching yourself
23,with someone to work with them okay so
23,if you want somebody more hands-on this
23,is something that you need to be
23,discussing with them
23,in an interview process you need to be
23,following up with their postdocs and
23,talking to them about this
23,you need to have an understanding of
23,that now the flip side if you're someone
23,that
23,wants more freedom there's inherently
23,nothing wrong with that either
23,but you need to make sure that you're
23,not going into a lab where they're going
23,to be
23,holding your hand and looking over your
23,shoulder all the time or you're gonna
23,feel miserable right
23,you're gonna want freedom so make sure
23,that you kind of get that in lock step
23,before you join the lab okay
23,so the last two things kind of go
23,together this is number five and then
23,the bonus number six
23,but they're really important things to
23,consider and this is something that
23,grad students don't usually consider
23,until
23,they're going out the door of their post
23,doc
23,so this is important to know before
23,going in
23,are they going to let you take stuff
23,with you is number five
23,and number six is are they going to
23,compete with you and
23,are they going to collaborate with you
23,so taking things with you
23,when you transition and this you know
23,before i go into this this isn't so much
23,for people that go into industry this is
23,more for those that are trying to look
23,for
23,an independent pi position
23,when you're done with your pi with your
23,postdoc i'm sorry
23,you're going to have to transition to
23,your own lab
23,you're going to want to know what you're
23,able to take with you
23,to that lab okay and this doesn't just
23,mean reagents like yes
23,some pis will let you take some reagents
23,with you which is good
23,but you shouldn't be too worried about
23,the reagents part because
23,once you actually get a faculty position
23,you're going to have your own funding
23,and usually the institute that you're
23,going to is going to have some sort of
23,stipend or allowance for you to spend as
23,a new investigator
23,you'll be able to get your reagents
23,that's not the issue
23,the bigger issue is the intellectual
23,property of the lab okay
23,you need to make sure that your pi is
23,going to
23,let you take with you your ideas and
23,projects now
23,some of the stuff that you've worked on
23,are going to be core
23,parts of their lab and they're not going
23,to necessarily want you to take that
23,with
23,that's fine but you need to have
23,discussions ahead of time and know hey
23,if i find a faculty position
23,am i going to be able to take some of my
23,projects with me to my lab
23,and if they say no that is very
23,worrisome
23,okay because you're going to want to be
23,able to continue working on what you've
23,been doing in your postdoc that's where
23,you've established yourself and your
23,name that's where your funding is going
23,to be
23,you need to be able to take that stuff
23,with you
23,okay building off of that is the
23,competition
23,and the collaboration and i think that
23,my postdoc pi was fantastic
23,at walking this line see when i did
23,my grad school it was on the biology of
23,aging and i have an
23,aging background and it was in the
23,context of metabolism but when i went to
23,go do my post-doc i specifically wanted
23,to branch out and do more hardcore
23,metabolism and less
23,aging so when i was in that lab i
23,proposed doing an
23,aging project and related to the
23,metabolism that the lab was doing
23,and the first thing that my pi said to
23,me is that's a good idea
23,but i need to check so and so used to be
23,a postdoc in my lab
23,and they're doing aging in this context
23,too and i need to make sure that
23,if we are doing you know x y and z
23,project that you propose
23,that we're not going to be directly
23,competing with him because i don't want
23,to directly compete with my old postdocs
23,that's perfect that's exactly what you
23,want you want a pi that's not going to
23,go and
23,compete with you and in fact what they
23,should do is they should
23,look at this and say that's a good
23,opportunity to go collaborate with my
23,old postdoc or my old grad student
23,let me contact them and see if they've
23,already started working on something
23,similar and if they haven't maybe they
23,want to work together we could share the
23,workload and we could really
23,branch out and have a real nice big
23,project between the two of us
23,that is so awesome that she was thinking
23,in those terms
23,and that's exactly what you want you
23,want someone that's going to let you
23,take
23,you know your ideas with you when you
23,transition to your own lab
23,and further you're going to want
23,somebody that's not going to compete
23,with you once you leave
23,that they're going to look at you as an
23,equal and someone that they want to
23,collaborate with not as a competitor
23,that they got to beat out because let me
23,tell you
23,they have the established name if they
23,start competing with you
23,they will win almost all the time
23,they're gonna win
23,so you don't want them competing with
23,you you want to continue collaborating
23,with them
23,that's a really important thing and i
23,think that these are concepts that
23,grad students don't typically have as
23,they're starting to transition into a
23,postdoc
23,they're more thinking about like the
23,general things like how do i find a
23,postdoc position and what's the
23,difference between that
23,and grad school but you know when you're
23,starting to find it that's when it's
23,really important to ask these questions
23,about what happens when you
23,leave because the day is going to come
23,when you leave right a postdoc
23,is just like grad school it's inherently
23,a transient position it's not something
23,you're going to stay in long term
23,so you also need to think about your
23,exit strategy and i think this is
23,something that really gets overlooked
23,and i don't see this being talked about
23,quite enough on the internet something i
23,think is really important to keep in
23,mind
23,so i you know i hope you guys enjoyed
23,this one if you did
23,make sure to hit the thumbs up subscribe
23,if you haven't again
23,when we get to that 250 subscriber mark
23,we're gonna be roasting
23,uh the 250 subscriber mark we're gonna
23,be roasting my old
23,you know dissertation presentation so
23,we'll see how that one goes
23,and i'll catch you guys in the next one
23,bye
24,welcome back everybody today we're going
24,to be talking about imposter syndrome
24,if you've never heard of this don't
24,worry i'll catch you up on what it is
24,and why you shouldn't worry about it
24,quite as much
24,so let's start with defining what is
24,impostor syndrome
24,this is something that pretty much every
24,single person is going to have at one
24,point and
24,or another in their life it's that
24,feeling of you don't quite belong
24,typically because you feel like your
24,abilities are not as good as those
24,around you
24,okay so the classic example would be
24,like a sports team so you try out you
24,make a team
24,and you start going to practice and you
24,think to yourself
24,god these other these other people
24,around me are pretty good
24,actually they're a lot better than me
24,you know maybe the coach made a mistake
24,maybe i shouldn't have made this this
24,team maybe i'm not quite good enough
24,that's impostor syndrome and i think
24,that all of us have had this at some
24,level
24,throughout our life but i know
24,personally for me and from talking to
24,some other people that i've gotten to
24,know well over the years
24,it's hit harder in graduate school
24,and even beyond as in like a postdoc or
24,transitioning to industry or whatever
24,your career may be afterwards i'm sure
24,that new faculty members also get
24,this but graduate school is when it hit
24,really hard and i also had it hit hard
24,when i was a postdoc
24,when i first started graduate school i
24,had that feeling of
24,wow like maybe i'm not smart enough to
24,be here
24,you know maybe i just i'm not cut out
24,for this and then the same thing
24,happened when i moved into a postdoc and
24,i said you know what like
24,these other people at harvard are just
24,they're smarter than me like maybe i
24,just don't belong here
24,and in both cases it was just me getting
24,inside my own head okay so
24,now that we kind of know what imposter
24,syndrome is that feeling of
24,your ability is not good enough why
24,is it something i think that we
24,shouldn't worry about that we should
24,kind of try to drown out these feelings
24,the reason is when you start talking to
24,people everybody's feeling it
24,nobody's broadcasting it on a loud horn
24,going
24,i have imposter syndrome no they don't
24,do that they keep it to themselves
24,but if you talk to enough people you're
24,gonna find this is a very common thing
24,and a lot of people have this you're not
24,alone
24,okay so now what can we actually do
24,to try to deal with this imposter
24,syndrome
24,well the first thing is just
24,understanding that imposter syndrome is
24,an actual thing
24,and it doesn't just happen to grad
24,students okay this could happen
24,anywhere in any career you know it
24,happens to people all over the world
24,so just understanding that there is such
24,a thing as imposter syndrome
24,that this is a natural feeling and that
24,others have this feeling is really the
24,first step towards trying to be able to
24,overcome
24,the imposter syndrome that you may be
24,feeling to understand that this is a
24,legitimate thing that people deal with
24,okay now as far as actual strategies
24,i think the first thing that we are
24,going to have to do is
24,learn to um
24,bring out our wins and accept our losses
24,so what do i mean by that the first
24,thing is to understand that
24,sometimes even if we have this imposter
24,syndrome
24,doesn't mean that it's because
24,everything goes wrong
24,okay sometimes you could have things
24,that are going right in your career and
24,you could still feel like
24,you don't belong okay but what you
24,want to try to do is when you do have
24,things go right
24,you want to actually try to stand on
24,those accomplishments
24,stand up say look what i accomplished
24,that this is really good
24,and feel good about yourself that like
24,hey you know what i got this experiment
24,to work or i got the result that i was
24,looking for
24,or i did well in that class that i on a
24,test in that class that i
24,you know maybe was having trouble with
24,before you know stand tall and feel
24,proud of those accomplishments
24,and when something goes wrong we need to
24,stop looking at it as the dead end that
24,um
24,i need to always have the answers and
24,that when i don't and this goes wrong
24,that this is bad
24,look at it as you know the classic
24,example again going back to sports is
24,you know what can we learn from this
24,experience okay
24,same thing in the lab okay especially
24,especially
24,the more junior grad students a lot of
24,times
24,you're so used to coming from undergrad
24,and high school where everything came
24,easy and
24,everything always was right for you and
24,now you're thrown into a situation where
24,you're doing these experiments and
24,nothing works and you're not used to
24,failure
24,and it makes you feel like maybe they
24,made a mistake letting me into this grad
24,program but that's not
24,true they've been doing this a long time
24,they know what they're looking for they
24,picked you
24,for a reason okay
24,don't feel that way look at it this way
24,the more times that you have an
24,experiment go wrong
24,later down the road you're going to be
24,able to better troubleshoot that
24,experiment
24,okay that your pi or the senior postdoc
24,in your lab that's able to look at your
24,results and go
24,that's where you went wrong it's not
24,because they're some genius
24,it's because they're drawing upon their
24,own experience
24,they did the exact same experiment and
24,got the same result you did
24,and they know when you mess up at points
24,a b
24,and c this is what the results gonna
24,look like so look at it as
24,each time you make a mistake or
24,something doesn't quite go the way you
24,want
24,it's a learning experience keep that
24,put in your back pocket and pull it out
24,later
24,when something else doesn't go right for
24,you or somebody else okay
24,and draw upon those experiences it's
24,going to strengthen you as a scientist
24,okay so what else can we do
24,i think that what we need to do is
24,overall from there try to change your
24,overall mindset
24,okay a lot of us have this really
24,unhealthy relationship
24,with perfectionism and it's fine
24,to want to perfect your technique to
24,prevent to perfect
24,you know aspects of your life but
24,understanding that
24,nobody is perfect is something that we
24,really need to start thinking about and
24,embracing especially in science okay
24,science never goes how we want it to go
24,and even the best scientists are going
24,to come up with hypotheses and
24,directions that just they don't pan out
24,okay
24,if we knew how it was going to pan out
24,then the experiment's not worth doing
24,experiments are only worth doing if you
24,don't know the answer right
24,if you already knew the answer there's
24,no point in doing the experiment
24,so sometimes you're going to do an
24,experiment and think it's going to go
24,one way and it just
24,doesn't right and that's going to happen
24,in fact it's going to happen more often
24,than it won't
24,and so we need to start breaking that
24,mindset of i have to be perfect
24,i have to have all the answers this is
24,not true
24,what you do need to do is know who to
24,look for for answers
24,or where to look for answers how to
24,develop
24,new hypotheses that's what we're trying
24,to do
24,make it where even if we don't know the
24,answer we know exactly where to look and
24,how to develop
24,knowledge on a particular situation not
24,needing to know
24,every single detail of everything that's
24,not what being a scientist is about
24,okay so the last thing that we really
24,need to do
24,is just
24,feel better about ourselves and i know
24,that this is like oh wow
24,well if i was able to feel better about
24,myself like i would have already done it
24,you know as someone that's you know
24,dealt with you know
24,anxiety before i get it that like
24,sometimes it's hard to
24,change your own you know outlook on life
24,but i think what we need to do is we
24,need to start celebrating that we're
24,doing okay
24,you know if you're watching this that
24,means that you're in a graduate program
24,it means that you
24,are doing a postdoc or you're an
24,undergrad thinking about going to grad
24,school
24,it means that you're in a position where
24,you're doing what you want with your
24,career and you care enough
24,that you've actually searched out advice
24,on how to improve your mindset
24,in different areas to get advice for how
24,to move your career forward
24,okay that means that you're already
24,three steps ahead of everybody else
24,so if you're watching this and you feel
24,like well i have this imposter syndrome
24,maybe i don't quite
24,get it maybe i shouldn't be here no it's
24,the opposite if you're watching this it
24,means you care enough about
24,your own career to try to make it better
24,and you need to
24,you know accept that inside and and say
24,yeah i could do this i could keep moving
24,forward
24,so with that i'm gonna wrap it up i hope
24,this was you know valuable to at least
24,some people i know that i had a hard

26,welcome back everybody today we have
26,another great video but before we begin
26,i know a lot of people that are watching
26,aren't subscribed so if you like the
26,content that i'm putting out make sure
26,to subscribe
26,make sure to hit the thumbs up if you
26,like the videos it's going to help grow
26,the channel
26,the youtube algorithm really likes this
26,so you know make sure to help with
26,channel grow
26,with that let's get into this video the
26,five things that i wish i knew before i
26,started grad school
26,number one is about delayed
26,gratification so what's delayed
26,gratification
26,there's a really good experiment that
26,you could do with delayed gratification
26,it's taking little kids
26,and giving them one m m in front of them
26,and saying
26,you could either eat this one m m now or
26,if you could wait for
26,five minutes without eating that m m
26,that's in front of you
26,i'll give you 20 pieces of m ms and what
26,happens is the little kids they can't
26,help themselves
26,they see the m m they grab it and they
26,eat it but as the kids grow and they
26,mature they start to say you know
26,i don't want to take that one i want to
26,wait and then i can get an even bigger
26,reward
26,more m ms and i kind of like that
26,analogy and the way of thinking of that
26,similar to grad school when you start
26,grad school it is quite a journey
26,and it's going to take years to go
26,through grad school you're probably
26,going to have to do a post-doc
26,afterwards it's a long grueling thing
26,okay your
26,20s are basically gone between undergrad
26,and grad school and a postdoc
26,and in the 20s what you're going to see
26,are people going and starting a job
26,they work there nine to five and then
26,they're done they go out at night they
26,go out on the weekends they don't have
26,exams anymore
26,they're bringing in good money um you're
26,gonna see them
26,start buying houses getting married
26,having kids and
26,you know there's nothing saying that you
26,can't get married or have kids you know
26,i
26,got married and had a kid when i was in
26,grad school and i know a lot of people
26,that were married in grad school or got
26,married in grad school
26,but you kind of have to put your life on
26,pause
26,while you're doing grad school and
26,sometimes it's really hard to see your
26,friends and and former classmates going
26,on and starting their life while you're
26,you know
26,busting away in the lab all day all
26,night on the weekends you don't have a
26,life you make no money
26,um it's really hard to watch that but
26,you've got to remember that delayed
26,gratification that
26,you need to go in with the mindset
26,knowing yeah it's gonna be grueling up
26,front and i'm gonna miss out on some of
26,that you know
26,early excitement but i'm gonna set
26,myself up in a position
26,so much better down the road number two
26,is that grad school is a commitment and
26,it is not
26,undergrad 2.0 so what do i mean by that
26,first of all when you go into grad
26,school this is something you're gonna
26,have to work hard at right like we just
26,talked about this isn't
26,a nine to five job okay
26,you're going to work hours and hours and
26,hours and hours and you're going to have
26,to go on the weekend to take care of
26,cells to take care of mice
26,you're going to be busy all the time and
26,when you're not in the lab then you have
26,to study for classes
26,you have to get ready for your qual and
26,pre
26,prelim exams you have to get your
26,dissertation done there's always
26,something going on and there's always
26,something you can be doing and
26,you start getting this feeling in your
26,gut of like oh i should be doing
26,something you know whenever you want to
26,take a break it's a commitment and it is
26,not
26,undergrad 2.0 first of all the not to
26,say that
26,the grades don't matter you should try
26,to do well
26,but really like when you go apply for a
26,job
26,afterwards after doing your phd no one's
26,going to look to see what your grades
26,were
26,as long as you passed and got your
26,degree that's all they care about
26,so the gpa isn't as important what's
26,more important is the lab work
26,and it's a different type of system so
26,you can't just
26,study and be good in the lab it doesn't
26,work that way there's actual hands-on
26,skills that you need
26,to succeed in the lab you know and you
26,need things like persistence
26,and the ability to overcome failure
26,which we'll get into in a minute it's
26,different than undergrad
26,it's not undergrad 2.0 and just because
26,you've done really well in undergrad
26,doesn't mean that it's going to
26,translate over
26,to being a good grad student okay
26,number three is learning how to fail
26,this is something that i think has hit
26,all of us and i know it hit me
26,particularly hard
26,when you go into grad school most of the
26,people that go into grad school are very
26,high functioning individuals
26,that have done very well for themselves
26,through most of their life
26,they're individuals that have done well
26,in school in sports and music you know
26,you know whatever it is they've done
26,well and usually not just in one aspect
26,of their life but they're people that
26,tend to do well in every single thing
26,that they do
26,they just naturally are good they work
26,hard and they become
26,the cream of the crop in many aspects of
26,their life
26,what happens is those individuals go
26,into grad school
26,and it's no longer a classroom right
26,it's not undergrad 2.0
26,and you go into the lab and nothing
26,works
26,this experiment fails that experiment
26,fails
26,everything seems to be going wrong and
26,for
26,these people um myself included i went
26,through this too
26,it's like your world crashes around you
26,where you all of a sudden like that
26,illusion of like i'm perfect gets broken
26,and for the first time you really look
26,at yourself as an is a
26,fallible person that you have things
26,that aren't great about you that
26,you're not perfect that you can and will
26,make mistakes that
26,there's people smarter than you all of a
26,sudden all of that starts coming
26,together at the same time
26,and it can lead to some isolation and
26,depression but
26,you got to keep in mind that this is
26,something that everyone's going to go
26,through
26,and so you got to keep in mind that just
26,because something doesn't work
26,doesn't mean that you yourself are a
26,failure there is a difference between an
26,experiment
26,not working and failing and you yourself
26,being a failure
26,try to spin it okay so this experiment
26,didn't work well what can i learn from
26,that what can i take away
26,you know the older postdocs and grad
26,students and pis in the lab that could
26,troubleshoot experiments really well
26,these are people that had a thousand
26,things go wrong and they've seen things
26,go wrong with other people
26,because of that they know how to
26,troubleshoot the experiment because
26,they're pulling on their own
26,you know personal experience or
26,experience of those around them
26,so just because something doesn't work
26,don't look at it as a complete waste of
26,time look at it it's like okay
26,now in the future if i get this result
26,again now i know where i went wrong
26,and how i can fix it number four
26,builds off of this that's in pastor
26,syndrome we just had a video about this
26,it's down in the playlist it's about
26,something like
26,feeling like an alien in grad school so
26,i won't go too much in depth in this
26,because we have an entire video talking
26,about imposter syndrome
26,but imposter syndrome is basically that
26,feeling of you don't belong
26,that maybe the pi made a mistake taking
26,you into grad school that
26,you're not as smart as the others that
26,you know you don't really fit in
26,this is something that every single
26,person goes through
26,and i guarantee you as you get to know
26,grad students around you
26,and become more comfortable talking
26,about this
26,every single one of them almost is going
26,to say yeah when i first started
26,i didn't feel like i belonged and the
26,same thing happens when you go for your
26,postdoc
26,everyone's going to feel like they don't
26,belong and when you transition to
26,industry or you start a job as a
26,pi everyone's going to have the same
26,feeling again everyone always feels like
26,there's somebody smarter than them or
26,better than them
26,and that they don't quite fit in and
26,they don't belong
26,just relax take some deep breaths
26,watch the video that i did about feeling
26,like an alien in grad school
26,and you'll have some ideas about ways
26,that you could cope with that
26,you're not alone and you're not an
26,imposter
26,you do belong nobody made a mistake
26,taking you in
26,the last thing that people make a
26,mistake is saying
26,i don't know they're afraid to say that
26,there's this idea that when you go to
26,grad school it means that you have to
26,have
26,all the answers that well i'm doing a
26,phd like i must be smart
26,i must know everything and if i ask
26,something they're going to think that
26,i'm stupid and that i shouldn't be here
26,and that's just dumb like there's no
26,other way to say it like that's just not
26,smart
26,learn to say i don't know the way that
26,i learned about this was there was a
26,uh grad student that was a little bit
26,more senior than me
26,and he was telling me that when he took
26,his prelim exams
26,what happened was the committee that he
26,had were asking
26,progressively harder questions and they
26,kept going harder and harder and more
26,detailed
26,and they almost got to the point where
26,they were just trying to find out
26,what point will he start saying i don't
26,know because
26,when you're doing a phd one of the
26,things that you need to learn
26,is you know what you know but what's
26,more important is you know what you
26,don't know
26,everyone kind of has this idea that they
26,know something about
26,everything but the deeper you go into a
26,subject the more you realize
26,the other things in life you don't know
26,as much about and you start learning how
26,to ask for help and learning where to
26,find that help
26,and the same thing applies here you
26,might really know a lot about your
26,subject
26,but there's bounds there's boundaries
26,where you don't know anymore
26,and the pis that are going to be judging
26,you in your preliminary exams or
26,dissertation or whatever
26,they can tell when you're making
26,something up when you really don't know
26,what you're talking about
26,so don't try to pretend like you know
26,everything because
26,even the smartest most seasoned pis
26,you'll hear them say
26,i don't know i'm not quite sure this is
26,what i think
26,but i don't really have an answer for
26,that that
26,is okay it's okay to say i don't know
26,it is really really important for you
26,to learn your bounds know what you know
26,and know what you don't know
26,and this is something that most people
26,in life that you see
26,around you in your periphery they don't
26,know that they think they know
26,everything about everything
26,and it's really difficult to get to a
26,point you know
26,to be honest with yourself and say i
26,don't know
26,i know what i know and i know what i
26,don't know
26,okay so with that we'll wrap it up those
26,are five things i wish i knew before
26,starting grad school these are things
26,that
26,if you go in knowing these things and
26,keep these in mind
26,you know that there's gonna be delayed
26,gratification that imposter syndrome
26,happens
26,that you need to be able to understand
26,what you're not knowing um
26,that this isn't just undergrad 2.0 you
26,keep these things in mind i think it's
26,going to make your transition
26,from undergrad into grad school a little
26,bit easier
26,and a little bit more smooth so with
26,that i'll catch you guys in the next one
26,bye
27,welcome back everybody so as promised
27,we reached 250 subscribers i can't
27,believe it
27,we're gonna go through and we're gonna
27,pick apart my dissertation and we're
27,gonna talk about
27,how disgusting it looks and the things
27,that we could do better that we've
27,learned over the years
27,so let's get into this i think enough of
27,you have found my name on the internet
27,so i'm really not going to
27,black that out anything that i will
27,black out is just towards the end which
27,is acknowledgments about my son and my
27,wife because
27,i think they're entitled to their own
27,privacy and we don't need to mention
27,them
27,but everything else you know this is my
27,name justin darcy
27,i worked in the lab of andre barkey you
27,know you could look up andre you could
27,look up me on the internet
27,that's fine um this
27,is the culmination of my doctoral work
27,and if you kind of want to know the
27,caliber or some of the caliber needed to
27,get into harvard
27,i think that there's a lot of different
27,people with different qualities that get
27,in
27,you know i published three different
27,first author papers this
27,presentation is on two of them one of
27,them i didn't quite talk about because
27,it was
27,unrelated to this i had several other
27,review articles that i published and i
27,also had
27,a whole plethora of um
27,co-authorships as well but you know
27,without further ado let's actually get
27,into this presentation and talk about
27,my dissertation and how my defense uh
27,presentation could have been a lot
27,better
27,so the title of my presentation was
27,energy metabolism and
27,aging i have my name advisor
27,dissertation
27,and and i defended mine on may 25th
27,2017. the first thing that i'll say
27,about this is
27,the colors for this presentation were
27,horrendous
27,i don't know really what i was thinking
27,at the time i thought that i was being
27,kind of edgy um but really the font we
27,should stick with a plain font like
27,like ariel or times new roman
27,and we should be using more of like a
27,white background
27,you know maybe some accent colors but
27,these kinds of colors like the grays and
27,these
27,dark dark blues they're kind of hard to
27,see
27,and the writing isn't very clear so i
27,wish that i had changed that
27,so obviously my thing is about aging so
27,i had a slide in here what is aging and
27,why i study it
27,um this is totally not necessary for a
27,slide i don't quite understand why i put
27,it in here
27,and there's much better transitions that
27,i could have used especially if i was
27,just verbally doing it
27,but you know what i had it in here and i
27,kind of talked about
27,the the different components between
27,genetics and environment that play a
27,role in aging and
27,and how it can lead to different you
27,know age-related diseases
27,okay just an overview of aging this is
27,more just an overview of aging
27,and kind of what the goal of you know
27,the biology of aging is
27,um i think that all of this is okay but
27,i think that overall what i would
27,actually recommend
27,is that a lot of these were homemade
27,kind of
27,slides that i had put together or
27,modified from slides that other people
27,have had
27,and what i actually think is a better
27,approach is to actually go into
27,publications
27,and copy and paste over you know take a
27,screenshot
27,of the actual figures that they have
27,and just cite them and i kind of stayed
27,away from that in grad school i don't
27,know i felt kind of like i was
27,cheating by using other people's
27,graphics and that it really wasn't mine
27,and that i should put in the effort to
27,try to make some of my
27,my own and really what i kind of figured
27,out as i was going through
27,later in my career is that
27,the graphics that that i make at least
27,you know some of you may be experts
27,but a lot of the graphics just are not
27,nearly as good as
27,what are in the journal articles and so
27,your best bet is to honestly like
27,go through and copy those and put them
27,into your presentation and don't waste
27,the time
27,making your own i mean unless you're
27,like super you know talented and
27,illustrator
27,it's just not worth it so i study these
27,cute little mice
27,these long long-lived mice if you're
27,curious about what a names dwarf
27,mouse is you can google that but there
27,are these really cute little dwarf mice
27,that live really long
27,and i have some background about them
27,and this is again back to what i was
27,saying
27,this is a schematic that totally could
27,have been copy and pasted from like a
27,thousand different articles and i
27,decided to make one myself and it's the
27,most convoluted
27,roundabout presentation that i've put
27,together
27,and it just this could have been so much
27,clearer
27,it really could have i could say that i
27,did a good job with the red and green
27,but even with that nowadays i think
27,people try to stay away from using red
27,and green because there's colorblind
27,people
27,so there should have been a different
27,color scheme that was designed it just
27,it wasn't the best
27,so here i actually did pull from
27,wikipedia which is honestly not the best
27,place to pull from because there's
27,again this is about thermogenesis
27,there's a bazillion papers that have
27,illustrations on this and i'm not sure
27,why i pulled from
27,from wikipedia i think it just was a
27,newer area that our lab didn't focus on
27,and so i
27,you know i tried to to pull that in
27,but i think that if you're gonna pull
27,any of these in
27,first of all what you should do is you
27,should make it like the whole
27,slide not just like part of it you could
27,even add like a black border around
27,the edge of the picture to kind of like
27,embolden it
27,and i think the captions should have
27,been better this was just again
27,not very well put together and then i
27,just
27,go into the data i guess i don't know
27,what i was thinking like
27,i didn't even give an explanation of
27,like
27,what the study design is or like what
27,the rationale is like this is terrible
27,like there should be at least you know
27,from here we talk about
27,you know why these mice are long lived
27,and that maybe energy metabolism plays a
27,role
27,and so i introduce thermogenesis and
27,then i just go into the study but
27,there's no connection there's no like
27,how i'm going to study this or like what
27,i'm hoping to get
27,out of this like i just jump right into
27,the data like
27,who made this i mean i guess i did but
27,this is just not very good
27,um so we go through the data and i will
27,say one of the things about the data
27,that i did well
27,was um all the figures are
27,easy to read here so you could be in the
27,audience and you could see
27,you know what the legends are you can
27,see
27,you know what the p-values stand for you
27,could see where the citation comes from
27,the title of the slide is a statement
27,it's not just some kind of broad thing
27,it says you know ames dwarf
27,b-a-t thermogenic mrnas increase like
27,it's giving you a definitive statement
27,of what this slide is supposed to be
27,showing
27,that's good the color scheme is good
27,it's easy to follow
27,you know the the stars that are above
27,the bars are easy to see so it's easy to
27,understand what's actually happening and
27,what the statistical significance is
27,you know these are all good things and i
27,know that when i went through this
27,because i practiced it a bunch of times
27,i did take my time and actually walk
27,through
27,each specific you know section of genes
27,that i was looking at so there was
27,actual definitive you know clarity in
27,what i was saying so that part is good
27,um we go through some h e stains there's
27,nothing wrong here
27,okay so here in this part i actually do
27,give like an
27,overview of the scientific study of what
27,i'm doing
27,why i didn't before i don't know but
27,this is good
27,um you know there could be a better
27,design for you know what we're doing in
27,the study
27,but this you know it gets the point
27,across this is what we're going to be
27,doing we're going to take these mice and
27,we're going to do this kind of surgery
27,and we're going to wait for them to
27,recover and then we're going to examine
27,the different effects of the metabolism
27,okay this slide is okay there
27,is you know good color coordination
27,the biggest issue with this slide is
27,that it was pretty much
27,lifted from the publication that i put
27,it in and the reason that this is an
27,issue is that
27,i have these a b and c's
27,listed on here and the issue with this
27,is that this is because this was done
27,with a two-way anova
27,and what it's basically saying is that
27,anything with an a
27,is different than anything with a b and
27,anything with a b is different than
27,anything with an a
27,or a c so it's kind of giving the
27,differences between the groups
27,but i don't have any kind of figure
27,legend anywhere put out that basically
27,shows what that means and so because of
27,that i think people got confused about
27,what are these a
27,b's and c's and why are there no like
27,stars
27,and i remember that when i went to go do
27,my postdoc
27,interview um in one of the labs i had
27,given this
27,similar presentation to this and i had
27,this kind of similar
27,abc schematic and i remembered like the
27,pi that i was interviewing with was
27,really confused like what does that even
27,mean
27,um and i try to explain it and they sort
27,of got it but it just
27,you know i should have made this clear
27,the other thing is like what is with
27,this y-axis
27,goes zero to 30 and then it's like skips
27,and then it goes to 30 like
27,what like why didn't i just make it from
27,0 to 40.
27,i okay i'm not quite sure why i made it
27,like that
27,um you know these are a little bit
27,easier
27,to follow but again you know these a b's
27,and c's are kind of confusing
27,and these y axes are are really hard to
27,follow
27,again here i actually lay out what the
27,experimental design is because this
27,isn't an experiment that many people are
27,used to
27,but i don't know why i didn't do this
27,from the beginning
27,all right so then we talk about
27,mechanism here
27,and i'm basically explaining what i
27,think is the mechanism of why their
27,energy metabolism is different and kind
27,of like how i'm going to interrogate
27,this
27,this is actually really good when you're
27,doing your defense or even when you're
27,applying for a postdoc
27,this is actually something that's
27,important is being able to specify
27,now that i've completed a project and i
27,have um a set of data that is now a
27,story
27,that i have something that i'm going to
27,build off of and what is the mechanism
27,that i think is driving this if i didn't
27,already answer it in the first part
27,now how do i further interrogate this
27,mechanism
27,and so this is actually saying that you
27,know this mechanism isn't just something
27,that i just dreamed up that i actually
27,have a hypothesis and a plan to test it
27,and that's what this
27,this back half of this is um
27,so okay again we go back to the a b
27,c's and d's so the g's
27,here represent in the two-way anova
27,that there is an effect on genotype of
27,the mouse
27,so whether they were like the control or
27,the knockout mouse
27,the t represents that there is an effect
27,by temperature so these mice are housed
27,at different temperatures
27,and g by
27,g by t shows that there's an effect on
27,genotype
27,and temperature that the genotypes
27,respond differently to temperature so
27,you can see like the white bar is
27,going from low to high to the blue
27,and then in the stripe bars it's the
27,opposite but anyways
27,um this is confusing as all hack like
27,nobody in their right mind that's
27,following this is gonna have any idea
27,what this means
27,um you're just not and there wasn't any
27,kind of
27,legend put into this so that could have
27,been a lot clearer
27,um you know again these g's and t's i
27,don't know
27,where this came from
27,and then i jump kind of into the
27,conclusions
27,and i kind of talk about the conclusions
27,a little bit but
27,really what i miss in here is talking
27,big picture these are like
27,bullet points of like these are the
27,three main findings
27,but what i should have included and i
27,got a lot
27,better at including as i grew and
27,matured
27,is some sort of a visual aid that kind
27,of walks together and puts the whole
27,picture together and that's really what
27,i'm missing here in the conclusion
27,is that i'm sort of just talking bullet
27,points of
27,this changed and that changed but i'm
27,not actually going through and giving
27,big picture like
27,cohesiveness of these things changed
27,which caused this to happen
27,and then this is the overall effect and
27,that kind of cohesiveness
27,is something that a lot of grad students
27,desperately miss
27,and i myself also missed it and i think
27,that
27,as you progress through your postdoc and
27,further in training you'll get
27,better at it but if you can um by the
27,time you're
27,at the end of grad school be able to
27,bring that cohesiveness together and
27,um show up one illustration that kind of
27,wraps everything together in a neat bow
27,you're doing pretty well
27,and then the acknowledgement slide which
27,is just the acknowledgement slide
27,um you know nothing special here but
27,yeah
27,i would say that that's pretty much
27,going to wrap up exactly
27,uh my dissertation so if you ever wanted
27,to look and see
27,what exactly does my dissertation look
27,like well now you have inside access to
27,it
27,so with that i'll catch you guys in the

29,welcome back everybody today we're going
29,to be going through a video that's been
29,requested in many different flavors over
29,the last few weeks
29,and that was in response to the video on
29,applying for a postdoc position
29,and today what we're going to be doing
29,is actually walking through
29,finding a pi to apply to their lab what
29,to look for
29,we're gonna look through how to draft up
29,an email
29,you know even down to how to put in the
29,correct subject line drafting the cover
29,letter where does that go where does the
29,cv
29,go we're gonna go through all of that
29,today
29,so if you like this you know drop a like
29,below
29,and let's get into this we'll have a
29,little bit of fun today what we're gonna
29,do is
29,cheat a little bit and we're gonna be
29,going back to where i actually did my
29,postdoc which is
29,at the joslin diabetes center and
29,harvard medical school
29,um just because i know that there's
29,somebody there that will fit kind of the
29,criteria of what i'm looking for but you
29,know
29,this is going to apply to anybody so
29,let's pretend that we're
29,a graduate student that's just wrapping
29,up grad
29,school and we've been studying some
29,metabolism maybe we've been doing some
29,in vivo work
29,we've been injecting mice with different
29,lipids and glucose and we're looking to
29,expand on our knowledge and we want some
29,more molecular
29,aspects so what we might do is we might
29,open up the internet and we might go
29,to a place like the joslin which has
29,research obviously in metabolism and we
29,might look through some of the different
29,investigators
29,so you could you know take your time
29,going through each one of them
29,but in this case i actually know who i
29,want to look at and that's
29,ron khan so maybe we've browsed through
29,different people and we eventually
29,stumble upon ron khan ron is a great guy
29,i know him well
29,so i hope he doesn't mind me using him
29,as an example i'm sure he doesn't
29,so ron you know you could look through
29,his stuff and you would see that he is
29,an internationally recognized expert
29,he's
29,the chief academic officer here at the
29,joslin he's authored
29,more than 700 papers and 200 reviews and
29,and chapters like that's a lot you know
29,his emails here which you could use
29,to you know you could click that and
29,then draft up your email
29,here's some different things about him
29,his research interest
29,so we could read here and see ah he's
29,interested in mechanisms of insulin
29,action
29,insulin signaling some stuff with
29,adipose tissue
29,genes and aging but a lot of if you read
29,through this it's a lot of insulin
29,signaling that's what he's
29,you know made his mark on is insulin
29,signaling you could click in and see his
29,his education publications awards you
29,know that's great
29,the next thing that i would normally do
29,is if they didn't actually
29,list out that he had this many papers
29,you know this is impressive enough if
29,you see this you already know that this
29,person
29,published but if they didn't have
29,something like that i might
29,jump on over to pubmed so we could jump
29,on over here to pubmed and we could
29,search for c ronald khan see how many of
29,them pop
29,up here and only a few hundred popped up
29,probably more that he actually has
29,obviously but
29,you know you could get a feel for he
29,published in nature reviews disease
29,primers
29,jci nature you know you could go down
29,and see he
29,obviously sell metabolism he's published
29,in you know a lot of great journals okay
29,so i think maybe this is somebody that
29,we might want to look into
29,the next thing that i would do is i
29,would look to see if this individual
29,has a um web page or a website for their
29,lab
29,so let's see if he does and
29,i know he does because i've actually
29,been on there before
29,which is one of the reasons why i picked
29,him but you know you could pick a
29,different
29,you know a different pi and look for
29,theirs and not everyone's going to have
29,one but nowadays it seems
29,a lot of people do so home so obviously
29,there's
29,different pictures we could go down to
29,the people here
29,and we could see you know ron a little
29,bit about himself
29,the staff that works there so he has an
29,administrative assistant
29,you could go into who the lab manager or
29,managers are so in this case his lab's
29,big enough he has two lab managers so
29,he's got a pretty good size lab
29,how many post docs he has so one two
29,three four five six seven eight
29,nine 10 11 12 13.
29,so he has 13 post docs right now wow
29,that is a big lab when we can look at
29,alumni
29,over my 30 years a major focus has been
29,mentoring
29,present there are usually 12 to 14 well
29,we counted 13
29,that's correct 150 fellows have trained
29,in my lab so think about that this is
29,someone that's published in
29,top tier journals that's had 150
29,fellows and that have started their own
29,labs
29,there are several of them that actually
29,work in his lab as post-docs and now
29,work at harvard so mary elizabeth patty
29,rohit kolkarni uh sang
29,not laurie goodyear but these three all
29,were post docs within his lab
29,um and here you could kind of look
29,through what are the people you know so
29,samir he was a postdoc from 2013 to 19
29,and now
29,he has a current position at the
29,university of kentucky and you could
29,scroll through here and see
29,the long long long list of people that
29,have
29,been in his lab and what they've done
29,research publications resources contact
29,um so you know anyways this is just one
29,specific person
29,and you know this is obviously a stellar
29,pi and not everybody is going to have a
29,stellar
29,you know program like he does but what i
29,want to do is paint a flavor for you of
29,what you should be looking for
29,these are the things that you should
29,look for is this somebody that's
29,researching something in the area i'm
29,interested in
29,how many post docs does he have how many
29,has he had and what are they currently
29,doing
29,you know what kind of papers are they
29,publishing you know these are the kinds
29,of things you would want to look for
29,and if you're not quite as familiar with
29,him it may be good to go into pubmed
29,find some of their more recent papers
29,and kind of
29,read through some of those articles and
29,see you know
29,what actually are they working on right
29,now and is this something i'm interested
29,in
29,so you know for the sake of argument
29,let's just say that he does some
29,molecular work with
29,insulin signaling and i want to learn
29,more about that so i want to join his
29,lab
29,so the first thing that i would do is i
29,would open up microsoft word
29,and i would begin drafting up what i
29,want to do
29,for a cover letter okay
29,so i would start off dear dr khan
29,my name is john
29,doe and i am currently
29,a fifth year post-doc
29,you know we're grad students grad
29,student
29,at the university
29,of florida
29,medical school
29,and let's be more specific medical
29,schools
29,department of
29,internal medicine
29,all right i don't know that this
29,actually exists i'm just totally making
29,this up
29,um my name is john doe i'm a fifth year
29,grad student okay
29,i currently work on
29,what do we work on we work on
29,whole body metabolism
29,including how
29,insulin impacts
29,post bariatric
29,hypoglycemia
29,all right so what we're basically doing
29,is saying that
29,you know we introduce ourselves i'm john
29,doe
29,that i'm wrapping up grad school
29,basically
29,where i do it and i do it in this
29,department
29,i currently work on metabolism and i'm
29,focusing on how insulin
29,impacts post bariatric hypoglycemia
29,i'm not quite as familiar i'm guessing
29,there's a hyphen there
29,um so then we could continue on
29,i in my
29,literature search for my dissertation
29,i have come across many of your
29,laboratories
29,publications on
29,insulin signaling indeed
29,one area that i want to
29,continue to
29,explore in my training
29,is the molecular aspects
29,of insulin signaling
29,signaling
29,since you are a world expert
29,in this area i have
29,great interest
29,in joining your lab as a
29,postdoc okay so now we've set the stage
29,we've told them kind of
29,we've kind of gapped it right so we're
29,doing
29,this kind of insulin signaling we're
29,interested in continuing this you're the
29,expert in this and that's why i want to
29,join your lab
29,okay now it's time to even hone in
29,more let him know you understand
29,what he's about i know that
29,you have mentored over
29,150 post docs
29,through your career
29,which would no doubt
29,lend itself to
29,to what's the word that i'm looking for
29,here would lend itself to
29,vast expertise
29,in training postdocs and
29,helping them reach their
29,career goals
29,in particular i
29,want to eventually
29,lead my own investigational
29,group as a pi
29,in a large research institute
29,and then you could add in a sentence you
29,know like i looked on your
29,labs web page and i saw that you have
29,people that are
29,you know currently faculty at x y and z
29,institute which i find really
29,fascinating you know something like that
29,and then you could add in something like
29,what
29,i think that i can bring to the table
29,is a unique perspective
29,as someone that has focused
29,on you know a b
29,and c so whatever it is that you've done
29,that you think could be unique to his
29,lab
29,i would love the opportunity
29,to sit and discuss no we don't want to
29,use the word
29,sit that's too informal i would love the
29,opportunity to discuss
29,my research with you and to
29,hear more details on what
29,i am sure are the exciting
29,research projects
29,ongoing in your lab sincerely
29,john doe okay
29,and that is how you would draft your
29,cover letter
29,something like this now there's two
29,options that you could have with your
29,cover letter
29,you can either have your cover letter
29,like this
29,in which case what you would do is you
29,would draft an email
29,that would say something like dear dr
29,khan
29,my name is john doe
29,and i am interested in joining
29,your lab as a postdoc
29,please please find
29,attached to this email
29,a copy of my cover letter
29,and cv i look forward
29,to hearing from you
29,best regards john doe
29,something like that and then you would
29,attach
29,a word document with this cover letter
29,in your cv okay the other option
29,is you can make the cover letter
29,sort of the body of your email so your
29,email would say dear dr khan you would
29,have this
29,and then
29,at the end of this paragraph here i
29,would add something like please
29,find attached to this email
29,a copy of my cv just to make sure that
29,he knows that your cv is attached
29,and then you know i'd love the
29,opportunity to discuss sincerely john
29,doe
29,and in terms of what you would actually
29,do for the
29,the actual like subject line i would put
29,something along the lines of
29,you know postdoc position inquiry
29,or application
29,for post-doc position or
29,interested in joining your
29,lab um something like this it doesn't
29,the subject line isn't the most
29,important part what's actually in the
29,body of the email is most important
29,but what i really kind of want to get
29,across is that you could tell
29,that in this body of the email here
29,outside of a few lines
29,most everything is going to be specific
29,to that
29,individual that i'm applying for so
29,obviously
29,your name and where you're studying that
29,you know
29,you want to be a faculty member like
29,these are things that aren't going to
29,change but
29,the majority of what you're actually
29,writing is something geared towards that
29,so if you're able to take the same
29,paragraph
29,and swap out the person's name with
29,somebody else and just send mass emails
29,to somebody
29,then you haven't written a good cover
29,letter your cover letter should be able
29,to be specific to each person
29,okay so i think that pretty much covers
29,it so
29,just to wrap up and kind of rephrase the
29,things that we went over today
29,the first thing that you're going to
29,want to do is you know even just
29,starting by
29,picking out different schools that maybe
29,you're interested in searching for
29,faculty there
29,or by thinking about people that you've
29,been citing in your
29,dissertation research you know there
29,should be
29,names of people that you can think of by
29,this point in your graduate school where
29,you're
29,thinking to yourself yes i think i might
29,want to do a postdoc
29,there from there you should start
29,looking up things about that person you
29,should
29,look to see if they have a lab page or
29,if they're listed on their department
29,page you should start
29,trying to look through their pubmed and
29,seeing what other publications they
29,have familiarizing yourself with all of
29,this
29,then what you want to do once you're
29,there is start drafting your letter and
29,this needs to be specific to each person
29,and i know that
29,as you're applying you do 20
29,applications
29,i don't know how many you're going to do
29,but say you did 20
29,you know i get it that it starts
29,becoming repetitive and it starts
29,becoming
29,difficult to craft individualized
29,letters to each person but it's going to
29,go a long way
29,and then from there you just need to
29,upload your cover letter and your cv
29,and again we haven't really touched upon
29,doing a scientific cv so if that's
29,something you want
29,let me know in the comments and i'm
29,happy to do one of those
29,but with that i think this video has
29,already gone really long over 17 minutes
29,so i think we should bring it to an end
29,and i'll catch you guys in the next one
29,bye
30,welcome back everybody today we got
30,another video that's coming from
30,a question that was asked in the
30,comments so again if you
30,have any kind of questions you want
30,answered make sure to ask them down
30,below
30,this is about what do pis look for when
30,they're to hire a postdoc what qualities
30,or key characteristics are they looking
30,for
30,in a potential candidate this is an
30,excellent question and these are things
30,that you're going to want to pay
30,attention to
30,i'm going to save the absolute best one
30,for last so make sure to stick around
30,for that
30,so let's get into this i'm going to kind
30,of split this up into two parts the
30,first part i'm going to go through a
30,little bit quicker and those are the
30,tangible
30,aspects that they look for and then in
30,the last part i'm going to go over three
30,different key areas that are the more
30,soft skills or intangibles that they
30,look for
30,so the tangible things these are things
30,that you can see
30,on a cv so publications grants
30,where you went to school you know these
30,types of things
30,so let's kind of go through these really
30,quick
30,um because some of these are important
30,but then some of them are not quite as
30,important as you would think
30,the first one is publications so i would
30,say for this one it depends on the lab
30,that you're going to and again
30,i i should preface and say that all of
30,this depends on the lab that you're
30,going to it depends on the pi
30,it depends on the institute it depends
30,on a lot but i'm trying to just talk
30,general you know what's going to apply
30,for most pis
30,publications you know
30,at the end of the day i think that
30,everyone coming out of grad school
30,should have one publication
30,um the more you have the better i had
30,more than one but i certainly know
30,people that when they finish grad school
30,they had none and sometimes it wasn't
30,even their fault sometimes they had no
30,publications and it's just because their
30,pi
30,is just you know real slow at getting
30,papers out and it's really no fault of
30,their own
30,however i think that you should at least
30,be
30,working towards submitting a paper
30,somewhere okay
30,they're going to want to look and make
30,sure that you have something being
30,submitted somewhere
30,and if you don't they might start
30,looking at you as if you were maybe not
30,quite as productive
30,as other grad students coming out so
30,that's something to keep in mind
30,the second thing is what lab or
30,institute or country that you did your
30,grad school in this i think matters
30,very little actually um i for a long
30,time thought that it did matter
30,and the more that i reflected back at on
30,my time as a postdoc and and
30,working after a postdoc i've begun to
30,think that actually it doesn't matter
30,quite as much
30,um when i was at harvard doing my
30,postdoc
30,there were people from every continent
30,that you could think of right so we had
30,people from the u.s we had people from
30,south america from
30,asia from europe from africa from all
30,over the place
30,that were in all different kinds of labs
30,and it didn't matter
30,okay the pis can kind of recognize when
30,they think they found talent from
30,somebody and it's not necessarily going
30,to be from someone that came from
30,harvard
30,now is that to say that doing your your
30,grad school at
30,stanford is going to hurt you no of
30,course not like it's going to help set
30,you up of course it's going to give you
30,an advantage
30,but is it an end-all be-all if you you
30,don't come from something like that no
30,so i did my graduate work at southern
30,illinois
30,university this is a small school this
30,is not
30,a big powerhouse in research or anything
30,like that
30,and you know yet i ended up doing my
30,postdoc at harvard
30,um i came out of a really excellent lab
30,it was a
30,you know an expert in the field but i
30,don't think that the pi that i applied
30,to their lab
30,actually knew that you know she knew
30,that he was
30,he was you know well known but she you
30,know they're in different fields
30,she didn't quite understand how you know
30,impactful this guy was
30,that i had done my graduate work with
30,and so i think that at the end of the
30,day if you're coming from a different
30,country it's it's not going to be
30,a make or break fake where it becomes a
30,make or break thing
30,is when you start getting into
30,sponsorship for visas
30,that's something that's a little bit
30,different and that's something that
30,i'm going to hope to cover in another
30,video and that's about
30,you know the visa situation for
30,international students
30,um now let's start moving over to some
30,of the softer skills because i think
30,that these are the things that actually
30,make
30,more of an impact so the first one that
30,they're going to be looking for
30,is your intellect and your scientific
30,curiosity
30,so obviously you need to have some level
30,of intelligence to complete your degree
30,and you need some level of scientific
30,curiosity but what they want to know
30,is you know do you seem like a smart
30,person you know
30,a smart individual and how curious
30,are you are you somebody that just is
30,there to do work or are you there
30,to actually really learn do you care
30,about
30,not just the techniques but the actual
30,science that's going on
30,this is really really important i would
30,say there's a few different ways that
30,they could question you on this
30,but probably one of the best ways that
30,they're gonna
30,they're gonna gauge your intellect and
30,your scientific curiosity
30,is when they talk to you about their
30,research and they ask you about yours
30,but in particular when
30,they're talking to you about their
30,research so what they're going to be
30,looking for
30,is an individual that is going to
30,quickly grasp
30,the concepts that they're talking about
30,you know you may not be an
30,expert because it's not your lab and
30,it's probably
30,not your area that you did your degree
30,in but you should have some level of
30,understanding of what they do and
30,they're going to look to see what kinds
30,of questions that you ask what kinds of
30,follow-ups what kinds of
30,ideas do you bring to the table and the
30,more that you could demonstrate that
30,you are interested and curious about
30,what it is that they're talking about
30,the better impression that they're gonna
30,have
30,the next area that they're gonna be
30,looking for is
30,really focused around dedication
30,and resilience for lack of a better word
30,so a lot of people become really really
30,complacent when they finish their degree
30,they kind of have in their mind that um
30,i have my phd
30,and i've reached the top and there's not
30,much more that i need to do
30,and what you need to realize is that
30,when you look at the scientific pyramid
30,of your career
30,right undergrad it's almost like high
30,school it
30,it doesn't count everybody's there where
30,you really
30,start is grad school that's kind of the
30,base
30,and then postdoc it's not really just a
30,postdoc it's post-doctoral
30,training okay it's further training and
30,refinement of your skills
30,experimental design all of those things
30,and so when you kind of come out and you
30,seem kind of complacent and that
30,well i'm here and i'm just going to work
30,for a little bit and then i'm going to
30,go
30,you know it doesn't give the impression
30,of this is someone that's going to work
30,hard
30,they're going to grind they're going to
30,put in the hours it's just like doing
30,another round of grad school
30,is the way you need to look at it that
30,you're going to have to really work hard
30,put in the hours put in the time you
30,know when you're at home you need to be
30,critically thinking reading papers
30,you you need to demonstrate to them that
30,you have that attitude
30,you don't want to give the impression
30,that you feel like you kind of like
30,know it all already because that's not
30,really true and if it was you wouldn't
30,need
30,post-doc training nobody would need to
30,do post-doc training
30,the last thing that they're going to be
30,looking for
30,and what i actually think is the most
30,important thing
30,and this is for obviously post-doc
30,training but even if you were to say
30,jump ship and try to go into industry
30,they look at the same thing
30,they want to know how critical your
30,thinking is
30,and how narrowly you look at the work
30,that you've done
30,so what do i mean by that a lot of
30,grad students come out of grad school
30,and you know
30,i want to say that 90 something percent
30,of grad students are gonna fall into
30,this category there's only a select few
30,that don't fall into this category
30,but there's varying levels of this
30,they're
30,very knowledgeable on this the
30,experiments that they did
30,and they're very knowledgeable on what
30,their results mean
30,and then that's it they don't have
30,a broad contextual understanding of
30,where do their data fit in with
30,the surrounding body of literature what
30,does it mean
30,they don't have a way to visualize what
30,they would be doing next
30,it's almost like they were doing
30,experiments because their pi
30,told them to and not that they were
30,doing them because they had hypotheses
30,driven ideas and that they were like
30,moving their research forward
30,what you want to be able to demonstrate
30,is when they ask
30,questions of you in your interview when
30,you do your presentation some of them
30,may be you know
30,methodology questions like okay what did
30,you do here what was this control for
30,things like that
30,but you what you really want to know are
30,the the the ins and outs the details
30,of why your research is important
30,where it fits into the broader context
30,and
30,what it means for the scientific field
30,and i'll give you a really good example
30,when i was doing my postdoc there was a
30,an individual that was interviewing for
30,another lab and i sat in on their
30,postdoc presentation
30,and i thought this guy was a you know he
30,was a pretty smart guy he had been doing
30,his
30,grad school work for a while and his
30,work was on
30,um some kind of nanoparticle delivery
30,system for
30,you know drug delivery and
30,one of the pis asked something about
30,what are the advantages of doing this
30,over
30,you know these liposomes that are
30,basically already fda approved
30,and and the guy had no answer he didn't
30,even know that these things were
30,approved or that
30,what he was doing was in direct
30,competition to those he just he
30,he demonstrated a complete lack of
30,understanding
30,of the surrounding body of literature
30,and where his work fits it and that's
30,the trap that you
30,do not want to fall into when you're
30,coming out of grad school
30,you want to be able to start piecing
30,together
30,everything and knowing how each thing
30,fits together
30,and what your research is really telling
30,you you're not
30,doing an experiment because somebody
30,told you to
30,if you want to be in a position where
30,you don't want to think about it and you
30,just want to do the experiment that
30,somebody's telling you to
30,then you shouldn't have been doing a phd
30,and you shouldn't be doing a postdoc
30,you should just get a masters and go
30,into industry
30,right so if you want to do a postdoc and
30,you're thinking of going into academics
30,or even into industry
30,you know when when you get hired for
30,you know a position with a phd they're
30,hiring you for your brain
30,they're hiring you to be able to think
30,critically to understand
30,every moving part and how it all fits
30,together that's what they hire you for
30,is you need to know everything you need
30,to know the techniques you need to know
30,the competition you need to know
30,you know the science you know dating all
30,the way back to the beginning of the
30,field you need to know
30,all of it you need to be an expert on
30,all of it
30,um and if you can't demonstrate that
30,you know they're not going to expect you
30,coming out of grad school to be at that
30,level
30,but what they will expect is to see some
30,semblance of that
30,right they don't want to see you know
30,attack
30,somebody that just does the experiment
30,and doesn't know what it's for
30,they want to see someone that's really
30,thought about it and understands
30,what it is that they're doing so i think
30,those are the big things that pis are
30,going to be looking for when you apply
30,for a postdoc position
30,there's obviously others and this is
30,kind of painting with a broad brush
30,i'm sure that you know more junior
30,faculty are going to look for
30,different things than a you know
30,seasoned veteran i'm sure that if you go
30,to a big institute or a small
30,institute you know all these things are
30,going to change
30,but i think across the board these are
30,the big things you know
30,there's other things that i didn't go
30,into like scientific integrity
30,like yeah scientific integrity and data
30,integrity is the most important thing
30,that you can have as a scientist but
30,you know i think by now that should be a
30,given so i kind of didn't want to go
30,into those
30,i went into the ones that maybe you
30,wouldn't have thought of that
30,really are you know critical things to
30,have
30,so with that i'll catch you guys in the
30,next one
30,see you later
31,welcome back everybody today we got a
31,really special video i know that we
31,talked about this before
31,but we have my lovely wife you on job
31,with us today
31,and what we're going to be doing is part
31,one of a you know maybe two part video
31,series
31,if you like this video give it a thumbs
31,up let y'all know that you like this
31,video
31,today we're going to be talking about
31,her trip from china and starting grad
31,school in the us
31,and what she thought about it and then
31,if you guys like it
31,leave comments down below of other
31,things you would want to know
31,and we'll try to incorporate that into a
31,second video which is a more detailed
31,video about things like
31,visas or money etc but today is going to
31,be more of a general broad topic
31,talking about her experience so thank
31,you i'm really glad that you're my first
31,guest on the show
31,yeah so i think the first question that
31,a lot of people are going to want to
31,know is just a little bit about you
31,and why you decided to come to the us
31,for grad school
31,um so my major in china was a
31,clinical medicine it's equivalent
31,to the medical doctor in the u.s
31,so for people who don't know um china
31,has the medical system in china probably
31,is like many countries like medical
31,system but
31,not like north america's medical system
31,so we go to a medical school
31,after high school and instead of four
31,years
31,regular um school um we will have five
31,years in medical school
31,so that's uh i like what i did for my
31,undergrad and um
31,so after that like a normal path for me
31,will be
31,uh like a moving forward to be a doctor
31,medical doctor in china uh however while
31,i was in
31,uh medical school i think we learned a
31,lot
31,of diagnosis of diseases
31,or a little bit of mechanism of all the
31,disease
31,diseases and medicine drugs
31,however i think as a good practice
31,the foundation of good practice as a
31,doctor is
31,a research so if you have a deeper
31,understanding
31,of all the mechanic
31,mechanism of drugs uh probably you will
31,have better practice so that's what my
31,thought was that's the reason after
31,i finished my medical school in china i
31,came to the us to do my phd
31,and my major here was a pharmacology and
31,neuron science because i
31,was i wanted to be a doctor in neurology
31,so you came here but if you can remember
31,back to when you were still in china
31,what what was your expectation of what
31,the u.s was going to be like was it
31,really like
31,influenced by hollywood movies or what
31,did you think
31,that you were going to experience when
31,you came here
31,uh yeah actually that's my that was my
31,expectation
31,i thought the us should be like just
31,like
31,in the movies like irish city or every
31,town
31,should be like new york and the
31,uh because i was going to go to um
31,like uh grad school and uh there was a
31,show very popular
31,during that time where i started to
31,applying for
31,a phd school here was big ben the big
31,dance series
31,probably many of you guys also know so i
31,thought that's probably
31,the typical academia life academic
31,life in the us that's for the
31,research part and outside of the
31,research part
31,um americans daily life problems in
31,hollywood movie
31,in new york something like that
31,okay so then when you came and obviously
31,not everything is like one big new york
31,city so what what actually did you
31,experience that was different or what
31,was your experience like when you first
31,came here and as you adjusted
31,um yeah when i first here my first stop
31,was
31,in chicago my school like a wayward
31,in the same grad school so our school
31,was in
31,um it's in middle illinois
31,however i flew from china the first stop
31,was
31,chicago you know chicago is a big
31,city so the airport in chicago
31,it's just like what i expected what the
31,us should be
31,should look like like you know it's a
31,big international
31,airport and with uh lots of different
31,people it just like meet my expectation
31,however when i
31,took the second flight to fly on to
31,the small town uh to have our like
31,where our school was it's a uh
31,it's a little bit shocked for me or
31,actually it's a lot of shock for me
31,uh actually before i uh went there
31,like the senior students already told me
31,they told me you know
31,this is a small town uh however it's not
31,what you thought like
31,the small towns in china you know the
31,small towns in china
31,it's also like cities like you know
31,it's not a new york but it's a small new
31,york
31,it's just a smaller size for everything
31,however
31,they told me that you came here it
31,should be like a village
31,i don't have the thought like what it is
31,supposed to look like
31,so when we were going to land
31,in the town where our school was
31,um it's on the i look from the
31,window from the flight there there was
31,nothing
31,it is the trees after trees and you know
31,they clustered
31,together it's like broccolis you know
31,like a little bit of
31,broccoli and and occasionally you can
31,see a small house
31,and that's it and when we were landing
31,the
31,the airport was just like a soccer um
31,soccer field you know just like that
31,small without
31,anybody i feel like very um
31,i don't know if you disappointed was the
31,right way to say
31,but i feel like very very sad i didn't
31,thought didn't think like this would be
31,like
31,the u.s should look like um
31,actually this is my personal experience
31,many of you probably experienced
31,differently
31,i was so sad i even didn't unpack my
31,package
31,i just didn't probably notice for like
31,several days i thought
31,i'm just going to take my luggage and go
31,back to china
31,because this is not what i experienced
31,the
31,like or at what i thought the u.s should
31,look like
31,but yeah like probably different people
31,have different
31,opinions you're probably very lucky and
31,your first stop
31,in the us probably is a big city you'll
31,probably have a different opinion
31,so there will be people that will do
31,grad school in the us but i would assume
31,that a lot of people that are going to
31,come are going to be in some kind of a
31,college town and you've been to other
31,college towns besides just
31,where you know we did grad school so you
31,think somebody coming from
31,china or india that's coming from like a
31,bigger
31,city they might be in for a little bit
31,of a shock when they come to
31,a small village like this yeah i think
31,probably that's the reason the senior
31,student
31,before i came here the concerns like um
31,tell me that have mentally prepared it's
31,not a small town with you
31,the type of small town you thought yeah
31,it's still different yeah
31,so when you came here obviously there's
31,the challenge
31,of adjusting to a new life
31,in a new country and trying to start
31,school
31,but you know you obviously also had the
31,hardship of english was a second
31,language and so you're trying to learn
31,this new subject and you also don't
31,speak the
31,the language can you talk about you know
31,what was school like and learning in the
31,lab like when you first started
31,and you know what kind of obstacles
31,were there and and how did you kind of
31,overcome them you know compared to when
31,you were in china your whole life and
31,we're speaking mandarin in school that's
31,your your native language
31,yeah that's a very good question i think
31,many
31,people um who don't have like
31,english as the first language probably
31,will face
31,phase two um so when you
31,come as an international student
31,actually there are two parts you need to
31,like face
31,immediately once you step out of the
31,flight
31,once you're on school right the other is
31,your life
31,um unlike the
31,americans they grew up here you also
31,need to make sure that yourself like can
31,live here um then you need to
31,communicate with everybody
31,you need to find your own house you need
31,open account for your water bill
31,for electricity and get to school
31,um to talk with the secretary to set you
31,up in school
31,so uh yeah like a you just have to
31,open up like be brief and talk to
31,everybody
31,to get solved that's the life part if
31,you guys are interested we can
31,make a video just about like uh how
31,how i always got through like uh
31,went through my um phd life the other
31,part is like a
31,justin suspension how do you go to
31,school
31,and go to school with like a second
31,language yeah that was very hard
31,before i came here um i talked to some
31,people already here they told me like
31,um if you want to adjust to the like um
31,like the lectures like the school here
31,you'll need probably at least like six
31,months so before i came here
31,i already mentally prepared probably i
31,wouldn't be like the first day go to
31,school and i know everything
31,so i think if you'll have the same same
31,experience or you are going to come to
31,the us
31,uh to have school probably that's
31,something you need also keep in mind
31,so why go to school to have my lecture
31,first
31,first day like obviously i don't
31,understand anything
31,when other people like americans or like
31,other people
31,um indian students probably better
31,are better because they grew up in
31,like an english environment so probably
31,better but
31,for us like um english totally foreign
31,language you you seriously don't know
31,what's
31,what's going on what other people are
31,trying to absorb all the information or
31,content
31,the professors are talking about at
31,least
31,in my opinion my mind was busy
31,translating everything what he's talking
31,about
31,the second thing is observing the the
31,information the first thing i'm trying
31,to say
31,what he's actually talking about uh so
31,the first uh
31,six months was like that it will feel
31,better
31,and better actually the first like a
31,month i will feel like
31,every day i can see the difference of my
31,english
31,with like speaking and listening
31,understanding um
31,yeah so you have to do lots of actual
31,work after school
31,other people probably have the slides
31,just to understand
31,all the content and the understanding
31,and memorize
31,or try to apply it to what your lab work
31,is but for me first thing i need to
31,translate
31,everything because you know like besides
31,like some simple words there are lots of
31,academic work
31,you never heard about it before i just
31,need to translate
31,czech dictionary and i think we have the
31,electronic like dictionary and
31,translate probably right now you guys
31,can check on internet
31,by that time i use the electronic
31,dictionary translate and write down
31,everything
31,and then that's my first uh wrong
31,go over slides and second round trying
31,to understand everything
31,and the third round and try to apply and
31,memorize for exams
31,so yeah you obviously need to spend a
31,lot
31,way more time and work than other people
31,who
31,speak english already yeah that sounds
31,like really challenging so
31,with your english what was the level of
31,proficiency like how well did you speak
31,english when you came
31,in general or like what you think
31,compared to other people were you
31,you know was your english good or did
31,you think that your english wasn't quite
31,as good
31,um i think among all the
31,international phd students i think
31,profit average
31,otherwise i wouldn't accept it or
31,probably
31,back in china probably i was like
31,better otherwise i wouldn't go through
31,all the tofo
31,and the gre and got accepted in grad
31,school right
31,but i think among all the other um
31,students probably my english
31,was average not the best but not the
31,worst either so i probably might like
31,typical like uh
31,if you unless then my situation probably
31,will be fit will fit you
31,too so actually something that we didn't
31,talk about beforehand speaking of like
31,gre and toefl and stuff if you could
31,think back to those times what what do
31,you recommend to students maybe say in
31,china or elsewhere that are trying to do
31,toefl gre applying for
31,you know different programs i remember
31,you had told me that
31,it was really expensive to apply for
31,programs because of the conversion
31,with money and that's something i never
31,thought of but do you have any advice
31,out there or
31,some thoughts about those yeah
31,this is actually it's a good question
31,and probably it will be a big topic
31,it will open up but i'll just say it
31,briefly um so if you want to apply
31,to a grad school in the u.s
31,there are i would say several steps
31,the first one is same as all other like
31,students
31,you need to prepare for gre but also you
31,need to prepare for toefl
31,which is for the language not like
31,english is not the
31,first language um people students who
31,need to apply
31,and also the same as others when you
31,apply
31,you need the your um all the
31,the scores of all the uh courses you
31,took and also the references
31,you know apply uh apply for one school
31,like in china yeah it's kind of
31,expensive because i think
31,for here it's like 50 bucks fifty
31,dollars probably yeah if you use the
31,conversion in china it's a lot of money
31,and
31,especially you won't disappoint one or
31,two you need to apply right
31,10 just in case right and it also will
31,pick the best one
31,to come um so actually this one leads to
31,another
31,question so i was lucky and both of them
31,were
31,accepted with the phd program
31,and we have a stipend waived right we
31,don't need to pay tuitions
31,oh and also we have uh
31,like like a living cost like a school
31,payouts living costs yeah
31,like one or two thousand a month so we
31,actually didn't spend like um
31,the money from home but for people who's
31,applying for probably
31,college here or master here money
31,actually
31,so it's a yeah it's a consideration you
31,need to think about
31,for living here that's something that we
31,should think about and maybe put into
31,another video if we do another one more
31,specific content on
31,some of these things um
31,so thinking back i know you you
31,obviously didn't do both
31,but for somebody that is maybe in your
31,shoes
31,you know when you were thinking about
31,coming to the us
31,do you think that it's i i don't want to
31,say worth it but do you think that you
31,would you have grown professionally and
31,personally as much if you had stayed in
31,china or do you think coming here helped
31,your
31,personal and professional like
31,development
31,yeah professionally um i
31,this is my personal experience i changed
31,the
31,area direction if i was in china i would
31,be a doctor
31,medical doctor right i came here
31,originally want to like
31,study research and have getting more
31,experience
31,over research and a better understanding
31,of medicine or medical area in general
31,and go back to be a better doctor that's
31,my um that was my original thought
31,but since i came here and i like
31,research so i stayed in research
31,so professionally i changed my
31,um routes so i don't know if like
31,what i would say but uh i like the
31,experience you know
31,uh personally personally like i got
31,stay here
31,yeah um but i think also for yourself
31,you'll open up like a wheel like you
31,have different
31,opinions of the you'll see different
31,things you will think differently
31,um probably this is what i wouldn't say
31,in
31,china or like i wouldn't think
31,yeah but i think for me it's worth to
31,come
31,and also your opinion um for every
31,real viewers in front of the camera
31,or uh if you guys like it you can come
31,if you
31,like after this you get some experience
31,and you don't like it or you think
31,your own country probably fits you
31,better you always have the choice to go
31,back right
31,so um it's like a actual experience
31,it's a you yeah it's a word to come to
31,take a look at this for me i think you
31,have to be so brave i couldn't imagine
31,going to
31,another country where i didn't know the
31,language and trying to do school like
31,for you and everyone else that does that
31,it's just so brave
31,so i guess we're getting pretty late
31,into the video so
31,i'll just ask if you have any other
31,general advice
31,or pieces of knowledge that you want to
31,talk to
31,viewers about that might be getting
31,ready to come over here and they're
31,a little nervous and and you know not
31,sure what to expect
31,yeah um first of all i think this is to
31,be brave you know
31,be brave like open up and don't um
31,don't concern too much about your
31,language
31,or just open up talk to people
31,they will understand you and believe it
31,believe it or not you are not the first
31,one or the only
31,international student in this whole area
31,or whole school they understand you um
31,and everybody is respecting you um
31,they are trying their best to help you
31,so just
31,open up and if you have any questions
31,just talk
31,to the people and
31,another thing it is probably
31,do um research before you come here
31,see if this field seriously fits you
31,and if this environment or the living
31,environment
31,if you can do it or not and another part
31,is like we didn't talk about the wayside
31,or just mentioned
31,for international student property visa
31,is also important see how long
31,they support hillary visa and i know
31,many viewers of you guys
31,are interested in postdoc um that's a
31,different topic we can talk you know as
31,come here
31,in the u.s as a postdoc your visa is
31,different
31,with the students and depends on your
31,future
31,plan the visa type you need to choose
31,carefully to
31,yeah i think that's good advice
31,especially what you're saying about
31,when you go to the universities that the
31,people there they deal with
31,international students every day for
31,years and years this isn't just some
31,random place that they're
31,they they know and they want to work
31,with you otherwise they wouldn't be
31,asking you to come on out here right
31,um so yeah i think this video has gone
31,on for
31,quite some time so if you like it make
31,sure to give it a thumbs up as always
31,especially to let you on joe know that
31,you liked it i know she had to be brave
31,again today
31,to come on camera and talk to you guys
31,about this i know several of you have
31,said in
31,many videos that you're excited to hear
31,her um if you have any questions for her
31,leave them down in the comments as i
31,said we'll probably do a part two and so
31,if you leave comments below with your
31,questions
31,we'll be sure to incorporate those into
31,the video or we'll be able to respond to
31,them just
31,you know in the in the comments section
31,and with that
31,see you guys in the next one bye bye
32,welcome back everybody i know it's been
32,a while since i've posted a video but
32,i'm back
32,i want to keep going strong sometimes
32,life happens sometimes work happens and
32,we can't get to the things that we enjoy
32,like making these videos
32,but now you know my schedule's cleared
32,up considerably and i'm able to get back
32,to making a few of these videos every
32,week
32,so as always if there's anything you do
32,want to see a video on make sure to
32,leave them in the comment section
32,i've been doing pretty good about
32,answering most every single comment
32,that's been left
32,and a lot of them i've actually turned
32,into video ideas so
32,make sure to leave those down below if
32,you
32,like this video give it a thumbs up help
32,out the youtube algorithm
32,subscribe let's keep growing the channel
32,and with that let's get into today's
32,video which is gonna be
32,not that long of a video but i think
32,it's something that's really important
32,nonetheless
32,and that's the what i consider to be a
32,good way of reading scientific
32,literature and
32,the reason i consider it that way is
32,because it one
32,is i think the faster way to screen
32,papers which is
32,arguably the most time consuming thing
32,right is actually like
32,deciding what to read and what's worth
32,your time to read
32,you probably spend more time screening
32,papers than you actually do reading
32,papers
32,and the other thing is the way that you
32,can critically think
32,while you're reading it to assess what
32,it is that you're reading
32,okay so this is something that's maybe
32,geared towards a more junior person
32,individual that's maybe in grad school
32,you know whether they're just starting
32,or whether they've been in there for a
32,few years
32,hopefully as you transition into a
32,postdoc you start you know developing
32,these skills because this is something
32,that just takes time
32,years and years of practice before you
32,could get really good at it it's just
32,like anything else
32,but i think anyone can do this so you
32,know before we get into like
32,what actually i do i want to talk about
32,how i used to
32,want to read literature and that was to
32,look through an abstract to get an idea
32,of what it was that i was reading
32,read an intro methods
32,results discussion
32,that used to be exactly the way that i
32,would want to do it
32,okay now the way that i normally do it
32,is i read title
32,part of abstract
32,and then from there i pretty much make a
32,decision should i be
32,adding this to my queue of papers that i
32,want to read
32,or is this something that i should pass
32,on
32,then what i want to read is the
32,intro slash results
32,discussion and
32,methods and i'll put an asterisk next to
32,methods because
32,i typically don't even read the methods
32,unless this is something that i'm like i
32,have no idea what they did here and i
32,want to learn more about it
32,and we'll kind of talk about you know
32,this newer way of how i read papers
32,but i think that for most of us when we
32,first start this what i'm highlighting
32,here
32,is the way that we would want to read
32,papers right you would want to read the
32,abstract
32,you'd want to read the introduction okay
32,like what is the relevant literature
32,what is the you know overarching idea
32,and then methods the reason that i put
32,this towards the end now
32,is that in general when i'm reading
32,papers
32,i'm reading something that i am
32,extremely familiar
32,with all the methodology in that field
32,there may be something here or there
32,that i'm not quite sure what they did
32,but in general you know the cell-based
32,experiments the in vivo based
32,experiments
32,the omics type experiments i know
32,exactly what it is that they're doing
32,i don't need to spend the time reading
32,the methods section
32,um unless i either don't know the method
32,that they're using it's something new
32,that i've never seen
32,or it's something where i'm looking at
32,the results
32,and i say the data that they have just
32,don't really add up like there's
32,something missing
32,they must have changed something in
32,their methodology and then i could go
32,back and look and say oh yeah
32,they only injected the animal with blank
32,dose which is you know half of what they
32,normally use that's why the
32,results look a little weird
32,[Music]
32,um but when you're first starting you're
32,going to want to read the method section
32,first right
32,you you're not familiar with these
32,methods and in fact you spend more time
32,trying to figure out what the methods
32,are than anything else just trying to
32,learn
32,what it is that they actually did and
32,then you'd get into the results and then
32,you're going to spend a considerable
32,amount of time on the discussion trying
32,to figure out what it is that they said
32,so what i did is i pulled up
32,an article that i am reading right now
32,or i'm about to start reading i should
32,say i've you know maybe read
32,a couple sentences in the introduction
32,but
32,this is one that i found in in the
32,journal science translational medicine
32,which is an excellent excellent journal
32,high impact factor really great quality
32,work that comes out of here if you're
32,not familiar with this journal i suggest
32,taking a look
32,and i kind of want to walk through an
32,example of
32,what it is that i personally would do
32,thinking about
32,all of the things that we just talked
32,about and how i would screen
32,a paper like this how i would read it
32,digest it and kind of
32,what i would be looking to get out of it
32,and how i would critically think about
32,it
32,so the first thing is you know where do
32,you find these
32,articles to begin with so sometimes when
32,you're first starting out what you need
32,is your pi to start sending you
32,you know manuscripts because you don't
32,know where to find them but over time
32,what you could do is start doing things
32,like setting
32,pubmed alerts for specific authors that
32,you think are worth looking at
32,i have email alerts for table of
32,contents for journals that i really
32,enjoy
32,um so i really like science
32,translational medicine
32,the nature series from like nature cell
32,biology nature reviews
32,um i get from cell
32,there's you know it depends on what
32,you're interested in so
32,you know if you're into endocrinology
32,maybe you want to get an endocrinology
32,you know table of contents sent to you
32,from the journal endocrinology um you
32,know
32,it all depends and what i did was as i
32,was i was reading through the table of
32,contents this one caught my eye
32,the title is anti-sense oligonucleotide
32,therapy
32,in a humanized mouse model of
32,2 duplication syndrome and the reason it
32,caught my eye
32,is because i am currently doing some
32,work with
32,asos antisense oligonucleotides and
32,you know i kind of want to see what they
32,were talking about and so what i did was
32,i read the first few paragraphs
32,many intellectual disability disorders
32,are due to copy number variants and
32,today there have
32,been no treatment options tested for
32,these classes of disease
32,you know this mecp2 duplication syndrome
32,mds is one of the most common
32,um you know this is what it does we've
32,previously shown
32,that a society can reduce this
32,in a mouse model however this only
32,carried one transgenic human allele and
32,one mouse allele
32,you know so they want to basically
32,change what they're doing they're
32,looking to make a humanized mouse model
32,um okay you know so far i'm interested
32,it seems like something i'm i'm
32,interested in so i downloaded the paper
32,and so the first thing that i'm gonna do
32,is actually
32,go through the introduction and i'm
32,gonna see
32,what they actually talk about and is
32,this something that
32,to me is two things one is it relevant
32,to what i want to do
32,and two do i feel like they actually
32,address
32,an interesting question that i think
32,that they can experimentally test
32,okay so if you go through this
32,introduction what you're gonna find is
32,actually something really interesting
32,okay
32,so there is this m-e-m-e-c-p-2
32,which is some sort of an epigenetic
32,regulator what it does
32,isn't important it's an epigenetic
32,regulator but what
32,is important to know is that if you
32,completely
32,lose function of this you will develop
32,rhett syndrome okay and if you have
32,too much of it you will get this mds
32,and so what they would like to do
32,is they would like to use an aso an
32,antisense oligonucleotide
32,to knock down expression of this
32,mecp2 so they can protect from mds
32,however they cannot knock it down too
32,much because if they do you will develop
32,rep syndrome this rtt so there's this
32,really fine delicate balance here right
32,they want to knock down this gene so
32,they can protect against one disease but
32,if they knock it down too much
32,you could develop a different disease
32,that's a really
32,interesting question to me and i really
32,want to know more about it
32,i also want to learn how they made their
32,humanized mouse models these are
32,things that happen all the time a
32,humanized mouse model is just a mouse
32,model that
32,expresses some type of human cell or
32,allele
32,um you know depending on the the
32,terminology that people use
32,um so yeah this is something that
32,totally catches my attention
32,so now that my attention is caught and i
32,would like to actually continue reading
32,now that i
32,have gone through the introduction what
32,will i do next
32,well i actually am going to skip the
32,results
32,i'm going to jump
32,all the way down to wherever the
32,discussion
32,starts and there is a specific reason
32,for that
32,[Music]
32,okay all scientific literature
32,is written the exact same and it's super
32,formulaic
32,and once you know what the formula is
32,you know where to look
32,for what they're writing okay so the
32,discussion is always going to be some
32,kind of variant of this
32,using a humanized mouse model of mds
32,this study highlights the feasibility of
32,titrating asos to decrease
32,mecp2 expression we found that the
32,expression blah blah blah blah blah
32,this is what we found blah blah blah
32,blah blah
32,this is all what they found
32,all right and so the reason that i come
32,down here and i read the first one
32,sentence to one paragraph
32,of the discussion is because
32,pretty much every single paper is going
32,to
32,restate what they think is the most
32,important point
32,and what their couple most important
32,conclusions are
32,and then they're going to go through the
32,rest of their discussion and they're
32,going to start framing it within the
32,broader context they're going to start
32,trickling in other you know pieces of
32,information that they found
32,in their article or that they wrote
32,about in their article but the
32,first sentence especially and then
32,through the first paragraph
32,that's where they're going to summarize
32,the big juicy stuff of their paper
32,and i want to know so here what they're
32,saying using a
32,humanized mouse model of mds this study
32,highlights the feasibility of china
32,trading aces to decrease mecp
32,2 expression okay so i
32,want to be convinced convince me
32,that you have a humanized mouse model of
32,mds that's the first thing
32,do they actually establish a proper
32,model of mds yes or no
32,and if they do can they in fact
32,demonstrate that they could titrate this
32,aso to
32,decrease mect mecp to expression
32,yes or no okay and bonus points remember
32,i said that if you decrease it too much
32,that yes you will protect from mds but
32,you would develop
32,rtt do they actually demonstrate that
32,that's like the bonus points if they
32,could do that we found that expression
32,of this
32,is downregulated okay so it goes on and
32,what i would do is i would kind of get
32,in my mind
32,what are the key points what are the
32,things that i want to look at and say
32,critically yes you convinced me
32,okay so then what you would do is you
32,would come back up here
32,and you would kind of re-read the
32,introduction just to familiarize
32,yourself and then you would start going
32,through the results section okay
32,so the first thing they do is they gener
32,generate
32,and characterize this humanized mouse
32,model
32,that's the first figure so that's what's
32,happening in this figure
32,i better be convinced when i read that
32,you know paragraph associated with this
32,figure and look at the data that
32,that is what they've in fact done so
32,what do they show in this figure
32,they show the breeding scheme the mecp2
32,mrna expression protein
32,you know confocal microscopy
32,and then what is this this is just
32,looking at memory right
32,open arms elevated plus maze distance
32,open field
32,rotor rod i'm guessing that this is
32,coordination and this is some kind of
32,memory that they're looking at
32,all right and then i would keep going
32,right
32,figure two widespread distribution of
32,aso mec knock down
32,blah blah blah you get the picture it's
32,rinse and repeat you're going through
32,each figure and you're saying
32,convince me i want to be convinced
32,if i can poke holes and what it is that
32,you're saying you're
32,you're showing me it's not a good paper
32,and in general when you get to these
32,higher level
32,journals that doesn't happen although i
32,will say
32,just because a paper is published in
32,nature does not mean it's a good paper
32,there is a lot of junk that gets
32,published in nature for one reason or
32,another
32,and so you need to just be careful and
32,make sure that
32,you really read through and that you're
32,really convinced
32,then what you do is you come down to the
32,discussion again
32,putting on your critical thinking cap
32,did they convince me of everything and
32,as they start framing the broader
32,context of what they talked about
32,do they actually you know advance the
32,field
32,in some sort of a meaningful way okay
32,and then once you're done you're done
32,and you could go through the study
32,design then later but i tend to use that
32,more as a supplement just to make sure
32,that i know what i'm
32,you know reading or if there's any
32,specific kinds of questions that i have
32,and yeah that's about it so
32,i think we're gonna wrap it up then i
32,hope that this was useful especially to
32,some more junior members that are trying
32,to figure out what
32,what is maybe a good way to read a
32,manuscript there's no one
32,right way but this is what works for me
32,and what i've seen works well for other
32,people
32,so with that i'll catch you guys in the
32,next one bye
33,welcome back everybody so we got a quick
33,video today and we're going to be
33,talking about
33,toxic pis now what i'm not talking about
33,is a pi that you sometimes disagree with
33,or
33,sometimes you don't quite get your way
33,that's normal
33,you're gonna have that in grad school
33,sometimes you're gonna think that your
33,pi is a little off as rocker
33,sometimes you're gonna think that your
33,pi doesn't know what he's doing
33,that's okay that's part of growing and
33,finding your footing and establishing
33,yourself as
33,your own independent scientist what
33,we're talking about today are those
33,examples where you have
33,pis that are just extremely toxic
33,that it is no good working in that lab
33,and kind of what are some options that
33,you can use
33,or should use or shouldn't do or you
33,know we'll get into all of that
33,so we're actually going to start with
33,giving an example of
33,a lab that i worked in that was
33,extremely toxic
33,when i first started grad school the pi
33,i was working with
33,there was always yelling there was
33,always um
33,a sense of trying to put each other down
33,and this was started with the pi
33,and worked its way down where even the
33,more senior grad student in the lab
33,kind of acted in the same way and i
33,remember when he kind of
33,you know he wanted to i think what he
33,wanted to do was tell me he thought
33,maybe i wasn't cut out for
33,it but instead he pretty much said you
33,know drop
33,out you're not smart enough you're not
33,going to succeed like
33,the way that he went about it was just
33,extremely rude
33,he it was like borderline just insulting
33,me
33,saying i'm too stupid i should just quit
33,um there was constant yelling it was
33,just a toxic environment that's not an
33,environment that you want to be working
33,in right
33,so what do you do when you have a
33,situation like this because this is
33,something that's going to happen to
33,people where they end up in labs and
33,it just it doesn't work out um
33,the first thing that i think that you
33,should definitely do
33,is try starting some dialogue with the
33,pi i know that you might be thinking to
33,yourself well
33,if this person is so toxic um you know
33,what good is talking to them going to do
33,well it can do two things the first
33,thing that it can do
33,is it can maybe smooth things out maybe
33,they don't realize
33,how harsh they're being or that what
33,they're doing maybe it works for
33,somebody else but it doesn't quite work
33,for you
33,but you need to point it out to them so
33,they realize that there's something
33,wrong that they're doing the second
33,thing is that if you want to eventually
33,try some of these other things that i'm
33,going to talk about
33,one of the first steps you need to do is
33,demonstrate that you've tried
33,all avenues to make things work okay um
33,so definitely do try to start a dialogue
33,with
33,whoever the pi is and let them know hey
33,like you know what you're saying just
33,doesn't fly
33,it doesn't work for me and i'm not
33,really getting anything out of this
33,um and and this is going to really be
33,the best outcome if they could kind of
33,change course and fix the way that
33,they're going because you
33,clearly join their lab for a reason
33,there's a reason that you want to work
33,with them
33,okay the second thing that you could do
33,and this is
33,more geared towards uh grad students
33,more than post-docs but this could also
33,apply to post-docs as well
33,is transition into a different lab and
33,that's actually what i did
33,so i started grad school i did not like
33,the pi
33,i tried having a candid talk with him
33,that you know the way that
33,things were going just wasn't working
33,for me and that i wanted things to be
33,different
33,but things just never changed and so
33,what i did was i talked to
33,the you know department chair you know
33,that's kind of their job is to oversee
33,everything that goes on in the
33,department and i said
33,you know look for x y and z this isn't
33,working and the first thing he said was
33,you know did you try talking to this pi
33,did you let him know
33,what he's doing it is affecting you in
33,this way and i said yeah you know
33,i let him know and it just it's not
33,working
33,and you know what he did was he said you
33,know if that's really the case then you
33,kind of
33,have three options and and these are the
33,three options that any of you would have
33,to
33,the first option is to just stick with
33,it and and
33,you know put up with it the the next
33,option is to just
33,leave right he said you could always
33,leave if you don't want to be here
33,anymore
33,and the third option is that if you
33,could find another pi that would be
33,willing to take you in
33,you know you could go work with them and
33,you know i actually contemplated for a
33,long time it was actually really close
33,to taking that second option of just
33,leaving all together and just saying you
33,know what
33,maybe i'm just not cut out for grad
33,school you know maybe it's me that's
33,what i thought at first
33,that the issue was me that it wasn't the
33,pi
33,that i was the issue and maybe he's
33,right i am just not
33,smart enough and you know i'm not going
33,to succeed
33,um and i had some you know friends in
33,the department
33,that convinced me otherwise that you
33,know you should look around and see who
33,else you could find and they pointed out
33,that there was a couple different
33,pis in the in the department that had
33,gotten recent funding and maybe they
33,wanted a new grad student and you know
33,one of them actually did and took me in
33,and it ended up being the best decision
33,i'd ever made
33,um because of staying there you know i
33,ended up
33,staying long enough to get married to my
33,wife and
33,you know we have a kid i ended up having
33,a really successful time in grad school
33,i really
33,grew up a lot as a person it set me up
33,to
33,you know come out to boston for my
33,postdoc and then transition into
33,industry you know it really changed a
33,lot in my life and so i'm glad people
33,talked me into not just walking away
33,and giving it another shot
33,but that is something that you can
33,consider um you you can consider
33,you know leaving my personal advice from
33,my own experience and from what i've
33,seen with other people is don't
33,it's not uncommon to transfer from one
33,lab to another in grad school it happens
33,you know
33,more frequently than you would think and
33,i'm sure that those of you watching
33,could probably think of at least one
33,person that started off in one lab and
33,then finished in a different lab
33,it happens it's fine just keep that in
33,mind
33,now if you're a postdoc it's a little
33,bit different um
33,you can transition to other people
33,within the department but
33,the department doesn't have kind of a
33,stake in keeping you there right
33,they don't want attrition they don't
33,want people just leaving their program
33,so they have an incentive to try to like
33,keep you within the department and
33,shuffle you to a different lab because
33,they want that
33,success like the completion rate right
33,of how many people
33,graduate um you can't get that if people
33,are just willy-nilly leaving
33,in a postdoc it's a little different
33,they don't care whether you come and go
33,or whose lab you're in so
33,it is possible to transition to a
33,different lab but it wouldn't really be
33,kind of the same route you would have to
33,more kind of
33,approach a pi within the department or
33,university and say hey
33,i'm doing my postdoc here things just
33,aren't working out can i come over
33,to your lab and that happens all the
33,time we had people that
33,interviewed um one that actually joined
33,the lab that i was doing a postdoc hit
33,he was doing it at a different affiliate
33,hospital
33,of harvard medical school and things
33,just weren't working out it
33,was not quite the experience he was
33,looking for so he reached out to the pi
33,that
33,um i was doing my postdoc in their lab
33,because they had done some
33,collaborative work and said hey you know
33,things just aren't working out in this
33,lab do you mind if i interview for a
33,position in yours
33,and it's worked out a lot better for
33,them so yeah that can't happen
33,if not you could just start applying to
33,elsewhere right
33,so now that you have your degree you're
33,not tied to any one specific place
33,you're kind of free to move about as you
33,want so don't feel like well
33,it didn't work out here and i just have
33,to stay here you know
33,if you're at the the end of your
33,post-doc or you're at the end of your
33,grad school and
33,things start turning a little sour
33,that's a little different
33,you know there you might need to just
33,grind it out but if you're talking you
33,know
33,early you know less than a year in don't
33,don't put up with it just leave it's not
33,worth your time
33,you're not going to grow the way you
33,want to you're going to be miserable
33,and one of the big things is as you move
33,forward with wanting to find
33,a postdoc or find a postgraduate job
33,you're going to need letters of
33,recommendation and one of the people
33,they're going to want to hear from
33,or two of the people are going to be
33,your postdoc advisor
33,and your grad school advisor and if
33,you're not close with them if
33,you guys really don't like each other
33,it's going to become really really hard
33,to get letters of recommendation from
33,them
33,so you kind of need them to be on your
33,side right even after you leave you need
33,to be amicable with each other
33,so don't force it you know for a lot of
33,different reasons not just a letter of
33,recommendation but for your own sanity
33,you don't force it you know find
33,something that's going to work for you
33,um
33,you know so this is a little bit of a
33,shorter video i kind of wanted to make
33,it just because i think there's this
33,perception out there that um everybody
33,that's going through grad school or
33,through a postdoc
33,just really gets along with their pi and
33,that's not necessarily true and there's
33,different levels to that
33,you know so there's people that love
33,their pis right so like i'm one of those
33,people
33,i was fortunate enough in grad school
33,and my postdoc to like
33,really love my post postdoc pi and my
33,grad school pi they're both fantastic
33,there are people that are kind of like
33,in the middle where they
33,like their pi they're okay with their pi
33,but
33,you know they're not their favorite and
33,that's fine
33,and then there are the other extreme
33,which is also i've been on that extreme
33,where you just
33,you you hate them and they hate you i
33,don't know if
33,hate's the right word but there's some
33,real beef going on between the two of
33,you
33,you guys don't like each other and you
33,guys aren't getting along and that's
33,fine
33,like that happens um don't let that
33,put a damper on your experience don't
33,let that
33,make you feel like you did something
33,wrong i promise you there are
33,other people out there going through the
33,same thing and you need to think to
33,yourself is this a situation that i
33,could just
33,grind through it and just finish it if
33,not what are my options should i leave
33,should i talk to a department head
33,should i talk to another pi
33,you know those are all things to
33,consider but it is normal to move labs
33,don't feel like just because you move
33,labs
33,you know that it's the end of the world
33,or that you failed or something because
33,you know i didn't i don't look at my
33,experience in that way i look at it as a
33,fantastic decision that helped me to
33,succeed really
33,um so with that i'm gonna wrap up this
33,video hope you guys enjoyed it if you
33,did make sure to give it a thumbs up
33,and i'll catch you in the next one bye
34,welcome back everybody so today we're
34,going to be talking about a viewer
34,question which is about
34,panel interviews when you are trying to
34,get into industry
34,and kind of how to tailor a talk towards
34,an industry audience which is a little
34,bit different than
34,what you would normally give in academia
34,so if you have any questions
34,i typically answer them in the comments
34,section or sometimes if there are these
34,bigger broader questions i think
34,can be addressed to more people i will
34,make videos about them so if you have
34,questions make sure to drop them down in
34,the comments
34,below you know down below don't forget
34,that nowadays if you want to get youtube
34,videos out to people you need to hit the
34,thumbs up button the more thumbs up we
34,get the more people that are gonna view
34,this
34,i hope that this is really useful
34,information i wish that i had this
34,information
34,you know when i was going through grad
34,school or a postdoc or trying to
34,transition to industry
34,these are things that i didn't quite
34,have um so i hope you guys find this
34,helpful
34,so let's just kind of dive into this so
34,in the three-part video we had about
34,transitioning into industry i talked
34,about the actual
34,kind of interview process and if you
34,didn't watch those videos i would go
34,back and
34,take a look at those if you're thinking
34,about going into industry
34,however what we didn't go in depth about
34,is panel interviews
34,so what are panel interviews and how are
34,they different
34,than what you've probably had in
34,academia
34,so i'm guessing in academia a lot of the
34,interview experience you had was with
34,the pi itself
34,and you may have interviewed with some
34,other grad students or postdocs in the
34,lab
34,but generally you know that's more just
34,them talking to you getting to know you
34,more than really an interview
34,and when you interview in
34,industry it's a lot different the
34,interview questions are like real
34,interview questions so the way it works
34,is
34,once you submit your you know cover
34,letter
34,and your cv and you do the online
34,application
34,you're gonna maybe get a call from
34,someone at hr which is gonna do like a
34,basic screen just to make sure that you
34,kind of fit
34,actually what they're looking for um and
34,you may not even get that it may just go
34,right to what's called the hiring
34,manager
34,and the hiring manager you know for lack
34,of a better word is going to be who's
34,your boss if you were to get hired there
34,who's going to be your actual supervisor
34,and they're going to call you up and
34,they're going to ask you interview
34,questions and
34,you know get a feel for how you are and
34,what they're going to do is they're
34,going to look for
34,two maybe three people that they think
34,are like
34,the best fit for this position you know
34,depending on the position they may have
34,three people
34,if it's not as big of a position they
34,may only have two
34,um and they're gonna try to take those
34,few people and put them through what are
34,panel interviews
34,that's your on-site interview nowadays
34,it's done through zoom
34,but when the pandemic is over it'll go
34,back to being literally
34,on site where you go and do these panel
34,interviews and the reason they call them
34,panel interviews is because it's
34,back-to-back to back-to-back interviews
34,and a lot of times it's with a panel of
34,people
34,and so how do they work and who's going
34,to actually interview you
34,so depending on the level you're
34,applying to
34,is going to determine who are the people
34,that interview you
34,so if you are a bachelors or masters
34,you know in someone with a bachelor's or
34,master's and you're coming in
34,you're going to be interviewed by a
34,mixture of people with a bachelor's and
34,master's and maybe some phds scientists
34,you know maybe for example i just uh
34,hired some people
34,that were associate levels so they have
34,a bachelor's of masters
34,and they interviewed with mostly people
34,that
34,are at that level you know to kind of
34,judge
34,better than i can how well they can
34,maybe succeed because they're the ones
34,that are day in day out doing that job
34,you know they interviewed with me they
34,interviewed with um
34,a sister position of mine which is
34,another phd
34,team lead and then my supervisor who's a
34,director level position
34,when i interviewed an industry it was no
34,real associates except for the two
34,people that i was going to
34,inherently take over and manage them so
34,you know they needed to make sure i was
34,gonna be a fit with them but besides
34,that it was all
34,um scientists and up and it was um a lot
34,of directors and a vp
34,and if you're you know even higher up
34,like a director of ep you probably
34,wouldn't even be
34,watching this video but you know in that
34,case it's it's obviously going to be
34,much higher level people that are
34,interviewing you
34,um and the interviews can be one on one
34,it could be two on one it could be three
34,on one so there may be multiple people
34,talking to at once and maybe only one
34,person talking to it once
34,and so kind of what are the general
34,types of questions that you're going to
34,get
34,so again it depends on the position
34,you're going for but
34,if you're watching this you probably are
34,either somebody
34,coming out with a masters or a phd and
34,you're going to be landing some sort of
34,a largely
34,bench-based position meaning you may
34,have other
34,roles within the company but a lot of
34,what you're going to be doing is going
34,to be at the bench
34,and so kind of what are the questions
34,that you're going to be asked
34,the first set of questions are going to
34,be technique based questions
34,so depending on the position that you're
34,applying for they may ask
34,different types of questions so let's
34,say that you're going to
34,a molecular based position
34,which does a lot of pcr and elisa
34,and western blot um you know your common
34,you know bench based molecular assays
34,they may ask you things like what
34,software or equipment have you used for
34,pcr before are you familiar with msd
34,fertilizer or do you just run off the
34,shelf eliza's
34,um things like that to get a feel for
34,like what you can actually do
34,and then they may start to probe more
34,okay so you've used
34,you know this type of elisa before
34,so how have you demonstrated that this
34,eliza works and you know
34,the way that you it you're expecting it
34,to work how do you know what's
34,background noise
34,um they start to kind of probe and see
34,as they peel back the layers how far
34,could they probe and how far can you
34,continue answering these questions
34,they're going to ask some basic
34,you know they i guess they're called
34,behavioral questions but
34,it's more personality traits soft skill
34,things
34,so if you're going to be managing people
34,they may ask
34,um how would you deal with conflict
34,between
34,two people on the team they may
34,ask things like are you a detail
34,oriented person or a big picture person
34,you know maybe they want someone that's
34,really in the weeds and
34,knows the details of everything that
34,they're doing or maybe they're hiring
34,you because they want somebody more big
34,picture
34,they may ask you know if we have
34,this scenario come up a lot where we
34,want to look for this particular kind of
34,biomarker
34,so if you were to look for this kind of
34,biomarker how would you go about doing
34,that what strategies would you use or
34,what techniques would you use to do that
34,they may ask about how well you can
34,handle cross-functional so if you're in
34,research and development can you
34,you know interact with someone in
34,program management
34,they're going to ask a lot of um
34,questions
34,specific to their area so it's kind of
34,hard to know exactly the questions that
34,they're going to ask because
34,the questions i'm going to ask is going
34,to be different than if
34,you know another scientist in my company
34,is hiring because they're going to have
34,a different need
34,for an employee but the things that you
34,can look out for are definitely
34,what your technique is and
34,techniques are i should say and kind of
34,you know
34,how are you as a person the other things
34,that they're going to be asking
34,are if you're going into industry for
34,the first time why do you want to go
34,into industry
34,they're going to be asking if you're
34,leaving industry kind of
34,you know why are you leaving the company
34,that you're currently at
34,they're going to ask questions about
34,what makes you interested in this
34,particular position
34,what makes you interested in this
34,particular company so
34,certainly you need to have an idea of
34,what the position is because i've
34,interviewed people who clearly didn't
34,know um
34,so do know that do you understand
34,generally what the company does
34,and what they're researching um you know
34,it's it's it's a shock when
34,you have these people that interview and
34,they clearly have no clue what your
34,company does
34,so you should have an idea of what that
34,is
34,um and this really won't apply for
34,people with a bachelor's or master's
34,this is more for
34,individuals that have a phd but you will
34,be asked to give
34,some type of scientific seminar to a
34,group of
34,of people that you would be closely
34,working with um
34,and you need to tailor that differently
34,than how you would give a scientific
34,talk
34,in academia so in
34,academia it's all about mechanism right
34,that's kind of
34,the basis of of basic science um right
34,and and trying to figure out the
34,mechanism of how does
34,nature work around us right whether it's
34,physiology
34,plant biology whatever it is like we're
34,trying to figure out a mechanism
34,that's always what we're doing so that's
34,always the question and always should be
34,the question is well
34,great you showed this data but what's
34,the mechanism right and then that's
34,the that's the large question finding a
34,big observation is easy working out the
34,mechanism is the hard part
34,in industry the mechanism isn't
34,necessarily the biggest
34,aspect so i will use
34,research that i presented
34,um as an example and kind of how i
34,tailored it differently
34,so i presented on a project where we
34,used a you know kind of
34,crispr based screening method to look
34,for new transcription factors of a gene
34,we were interested in
34,and if i was giving this talk in
34,academia what i would have done
34,was kind of given the background of like
34,why we're interested in this gene
34,i would have you know shown the data
34,from this crisper screen
34,said this is the target and then shown
34,all the validation and worked out all of
34,the mechanism
34,and then cool this is like you know what
34,we wanted to learn
34,but when i actually gave my talk it was
34,all geared a little bit differently
34,first of all
34,the people that i was giving to talk to
34,were not subject
34,experts in this area so i had to paint
34,with a broader stroke because
34,you know they wouldn't understand and
34,all the weeds you know where i was
34,and their interests are different they
34,want translational
34,in industry it's all about translation
34,it's not about mechanism
34,it's about translation so the way that
34,you set it up
34,is this is the disease state this is the
34,disease
34,that i am interested in that's the first
34,thing is always establishing the disease
34,that you are interested in
34,this is why i'm going to target this
34,specific
34,gene in this disease you set up your big
34,screen and explain
34,what the screen is and what you hope to
34,accomplish and then
34,you basically transition into this is
34,what i picked as my target
34,and how i validated it right target
34,validation is super
34,important in industry and then from
34,there
34,it's not so much working out the
34,mechanism although i did talk a little
34,bit about mechanism
34,it was more how could you apply this in
34,a way that would be translatable so
34,if i were to start up my own biotech
34,this is what i would do to target this
34,and like what i think i would be able to
34,accomplish
34,and even if you weren't right about
34,every little process that would happen
34,at least you demonstrate that you're
34,thinking in those terms of like how can
34,i help a patient
34,all the companies want to be
34,patient-centric so you need to kind of
34,paint yourself as that that this is kind
34,of the area that that i'm interested in
34,this is
34,the angle i'm coming at it at is it's
34,not just about finding the mechanism and
34,that
34,it is important and cool to do that but
34,really what i want is something
34,translatable that's going to help a
34,patient
34,and if i could help a patient then i
34,would be a good fit for your company
34,and that's kind of the way that you need
34,to paint yourself when you apply for a
34,job in industry
34,you got to keep that in mind when you
34,interview they want to know that you're
34,a
34,patient-centric person um so i hope that
34,this answers that
34,individual's question i know that if
34,you have other questions that you know
34,sometimes you don't
34,want a whole video made about it that's
34,fine like you know you can
34,write them in the comment section i
34,could just answer it but
34,if you like this kind of thing make sure
34,to comment that
34,you know this is a question that i do
34,have please make a video about it and
34,you know if it's something that's
34,broad enough that could help enough
34,people i'd really be happy to make
34,videos about it because
34,one thing i've learned is a lot of
34,people have the same question
34,you know a lot of things that you guys
34,are asking are things that i also
34,wondered my wife
34,also wondered other colleagues i have
34,also wondered
34,so you're not the only one that's
34,wondering you know some of these things
34,and it's good to
34,get it off your chest and talk about it
34,with you guys so
34,with that i hope you guys enjoy this
34,video and i'll catch you guys in the
34,next one
34,bye
35,welcome back everybody we got a great
35,video today one that you're definitely
35,not going to want to miss and one that i
35,think a lot of you are going to
35,appreciate
35,and that is how to draft up a cv if
35,you're a more senior grad student going
35,in for a postdoc
35,now if you want to see videos about
35,different kinds of cvs whether it's for
35,industry or someone that's got more
35,experience
35,drop a like leave a comment and let me
35,know and that's something that we could
35,work out
35,but today we're going to be focusing on
35,you know a more senior grad
35,student what people may have at that
35,level you know some people may have more
35,some may have less but kind of
35,how you should construct your cv some
35,do's and don'ts along the way
35,and we're gonna you know do this
35,together i don't have one already
35,drafted because i want you guys to be
35,able to see
35,all the different pieces that i pick and
35,how i put this together
35,so with that let's get into it the first
35,thing we're going to want to do is pick
35,a font
35,and you want to make sure that you're
35,using the same font all the way through
35,you know you don't want some of these
35,people go overboard on style they have
35,different fonts they have all different
35,sizes all over
35,for their text they have bold here and
35,italics here and there's
35,really no reason for it they just bold
35,everything
35,so you need to keep it simple and calm
35,and not make it
35,so flamboyant and all over the place
35,so we're gonna make up a grad student
35,here john smith
35,so i'll just make him his name in 14
35,points not
35,font so the name and some of the more
35,call out
35,areas i'm gonna put in this larger font
35,we could go into putting in his contact
35,info up here on the top that's going to
35,be something that
35,pi's will be interested in so we'll just
35,say that he lives at one two
35,not bold one two three main street
35,boston massachusetts
35,zero one nine
35,five zero i'm not sure if that's really
35,in the zip code in boston but we're
35,gonna make it one
35,we could put in his phone number one two
35,three
35,four five six seven eight nine zero
35,and we want to put in some other
35,information from him
35,in this same thing so you could either
35,add in like a vertical line in between
35,that's one option that i've seen the
35,option that i tend to go with
35,is going to this advanced symbol and
35,clicking on this little
35,guy right here that'll put this little
35,dot kind of in the middle
35,we can put john smith gmail.com
35,and we could add you know
35,another one in here and have it be for
35,his
35,linkedin you know
35,profile url but you could use linkedin
35,or or research gate whatever it is that
35,you use now the next thing that we're
35,going to be wanting to do
35,is we want to move over to the left
35,we will click bold
35,make it a larger font and we will write
35,professional
35,summary now this is really important
35,what you want to be able to do here is
35,to convey
35,to those that are going to be taking a
35,look at your cv
35,kind of what it is that you've done
35,in a few sentences high
35,overarching picture okay and your
35,professional summary is going to change
35,as you develop through your career and
35,depending on the position that you're
35,applying for you're going to want to
35,always
35,tailor this section so it's not just
35,going to be one thing that you leave and
35,you never change
35,this is something that you'll always
35,have to come back to but
35,you know let's say that john smith was a
35,senior grad student
35,in the genetics department and now he
35,is looking to do a postdoc in the field
35,of immunology okay so
35,we could put in here something like this
35,a
35,oh we should make the text smaller
35,a highly motivated scientist
35,driven by the desire to
35,elucidate novel
35,genomic mechanisms of
35,disease okay proficient
35,in a variety of
35,in vitro and in vivo
35,techniques including
35,cell culture
35,western blotting
35,and intraperitoneal
35,injections
35,fast learner
35,and
35,excellent collaborator
35,all right so this is our professional
35,statement now one thing that
35,i personally like to do is justify the
35,text
35,so that everything is nice and even
35,going down you don't have to do that
35,again this is all
35,personal preference other things that
35,you can do is you can try
35,you know adding an underline under
35,professional summary
35,there are ways where you can make a line
35,going all the way across um
35,you know you could look up a bunch of
35,different stylistic things to break it
35,up how you want
35,for this we're just going to keep it
35,simple and we're just going to be going
35,through the different sections and kind
35,of
35,what it is that you want to be putting
35,in each section
35,so for the next section what we're going
35,to want to do is we're going to want to
35,put our education
35,all right so in a cv
35,when you're applying to industry it's a
35,little bit different but in an academic
35,cv
35,want to be in chronological order so
35,what we could do is we could say from
35,make this smaller again we could say
35,from
35,2000 to 2004 we got our
35,bachelor of science and we got it
35,in
35,physiology
35,and we got this at
35,you know yale university
35,yeah you know what let's make it more
35,relatable
35,we'll go to vanderbilt
35,vanderbilt and
35,vanderbilt is in nashville tennessee
35,and then let's say that we're
35,from 2004 to present
35,we're doing our phd in
35,genetics at harvard
35,i think that's what i had said earlier
35,we'll pretend that he's doing his
35,genetics at harvard
35,harvard university
35,cambridge
35,massachusetts something like this
35,there's different ways that you could
35,format this
35,so you could do something like
35,genetic um i'm sorry you could do
35,something like
35,harvard university
35,university and then over here you could
35,put your
35,the years that you were in school
35,so 2000 to 2004
35,and then underneath here you could do
35,phd
35,genetics something like this
35,there's all different ways that you
35,could format it but basically what you
35,want to do is get
35,get this point across um underneath here
35,you could put like your
35,advisor's name that may be something
35,that's important
35,so jane doe
35,is our advisor okay
35,the next section that we're going to
35,want to do is
35,our experience
35,again this is going to be in
35,chronological order
35,and what we're going to want to do is do
35,a couple different things here
35,we're going to want to put where we were
35,working and kind of what we were working
35,on and kind of do it in bullet points
35,so let's say that our first experience
35,in doing some sort of lab work
35,was in you know the
35,undergrad research experience so we
35,could put that from 2003 to 2004
35,right so our last couple years we did
35,research and we were
35,an undergraduate
35,researcher
35,and we could say that we were at
35,vanderbilt
35,nashville tennessee all right and then
35,what we could do
35,is we could just do some bullet points
35,of what it was that we were working on
35,cleaned glassware
35,isolated rna and protein
35,prepared
35,reagents
35,prepared reagents for graduate students
35,and we could say that we also performed
35,simple or not simple we should say
35,performed
35,molecular techniques
35,such as pcr you know and you would go
35,down and list exactly what it was that
35,you did
35,we could even bring this over so it's
35,kind of
35,over here and then you would go on to
35,your next thing okay so then from 2004
35,to present
35,is graduate
35,student or doctoral researcher
35,you know harvard
35,you know in cambridge you know you would
35,go on and say what you were
35,what you were doing okay
35,so you would go on and you would keep
35,doing this for all your experience
35,now what things can you do to draw
35,attention
35,so let's say that this is a lab
35,that specializes in
35,immunology right you want to go for a
35,position in an immunology lab
35,well maybe you want to draw attention to
35,that so maybe you would
35,have somewhere in here where you're
35,saying you know
35,performed
35,genetic
35,perform genetic
35,manipulation in
35,hela cells
35,and you know blank blank blank
35,to inform on
35,the immunology of
35,you know cervical cancer
35,and in there you could do something like
35,bold a specific
35,word that you want to draw attention to
35,right
35,or you could do bolding like bold the
35,position that you had
35,those are some areas that you could add
35,bold in you don't want to just make
35,everything bold though that's going to
35,become too distracting
35,other areas that you should be
35,highlighting on your cv
35,are
35,professional memberships or societal
35,memberships so hopefully you guys have
35,memberships to certain you know
35,professional society so let's say like
35,from 2004
35,to 2006 we were a member of the
35,endocrine society
35,you know whatever it is that you're that
35,you're on you can go through and list
35,all of them
35,we definitely are going to want
35,something that is for
35,our awards or
35,awards and honors or awards and
35,recognition
35,you know whatever it might be so let's
35,say that in
35,2005 we won an award for the
35,best student publication
35,award you know whatever the name of the
35,award is you know we don't have
35,large at this point large awards like
35,you're going to be getting
35,in you know an experienced pi that's
35,been around for 50 years you're not
35,going to have a nobel prize
35,written obviously but you want to fill
35,in your cv and let them know you
35,accomplish something even if it's
35,something that's not
35,the biggest thing so it could be like if
35,your department does
35,journal clubs or you know rotates
35,through students doing presentations of
35,their research and you won like best
35,presentation award
35,put that in there if you want a travel
35,award
35,put that in there you know keep adding
35,lines to your cv
35,we are definitely going to want
35,something for
35,abstracts
35,right so we want to let them know that
35,we were
35,presenting it at different places so it
35,could be something like smith
35,j do j
35,you know you go on and you list
35,everybody that it is
35,make sure your name is in bold list
35,everyone that's involved
35,and then you would put your title so
35,genetic manipulation of
35,hela cells
35,and you submitted it to the
35,endocrine society
35,yearly meeting you know whatever the
35,name of the meeting is i don't know that
35,the endocrine society has something
35,called an endocrine society yearly
35,meeting but
35,and that was in 2004.
35,okay you're definitely going to want to
35,put
35,publications if you have any hopefully
35,by this point
35,in your career you do but you would put
35,in your publications you know same thing
35,as the abstracts it would be
35,smith j
35,smith j
35,do j you know
35,genetic blah blah blah blah blah and
35,then you know
35,the name of the journal article that you
35,published and all the information you
35,could just copy it right off of pubmed
35,but you're going to want to put
35,publications obviously if you have any
35,of those
35,and then any other things that could
35,stand out
35,so things that aren't going to be as
35,common but things that maybe you have
35,you could have
35,editorial activities
35,okay so let's say that your pi um
35,asked you to help review a journal
35,article that was submitted to a journal
35,and you
35,served as a peer reviewer you might want
35,to put that you were a peer reviewer
35,down under editorial activities
35,you might have grants
35,right so maybe you secured some kind of
35,pre-doctoral fellowship or
35,a diversity grant you know there's all
35,different kinds of grants you could get
35,you'd want to put those down again
35,the idea is to keep adding lines to your
35,cv
35,you want to keep building yourself in a
35,way
35,where they say yeah this person has
35,really accomplished a lot
35,it's not just about like where you did
35,your studying right so
35,when i applied for my postdoc
35,at harvard you know it's not like i had
35,yale written on my cv at the time
35,you know i was coming out of southern
35,illinois university it's a very small
35,school
35,but i had a lot on my cv i had worked
35,hard
35,to get that but that's kind of what you
35,want in yours
35,is to keep working and building it up
35,and adding lines
35,the last thing that you're going to want
35,to be putting on here you know
35,again it doesn't matter where you put it
35,but one important
35,thing that you're going to want to make
35,sure that you add on here is something
35,like
35,um techniques
35,or lab skills
35,or you know bench skills
35,whatever it is that you're going to call
35,it you want to be able to put like the
35,lab techniques that you know
35,and the way that i would do it is i
35,would actually break it up so what i
35,would do is i would do like
35,um in vivo
35,and then what i would do is i would list
35,them out so what are the in vivo skills
35,that we know we know like
35,animal handling we know
35,you know tumor implantation
35,we know glucose tolerance test
35,tolerance test you know whatever it is
35,that we know
35,put everything in vivo then we would go
35,into in vitro
35,okay you know same thing we know how to
35,culture x y and z
35,cells we know how to transfect we know
35,how to
35,create stable cell lines you know
35,whatever it is that we can do
35,and then you would go into maybe
35,molecular
35,if you're in a molecular environment so
35,things like pcr
35,or staining or you know whatever it is
35,and you'll figure out the best way to
35,break up your techniques but you're
35,going to want to put your techniques
35,because
35,the person that's actually looking to
35,get you is going to want to know
35,what it is that you can do okay what are
35,the techniques that you could do
35,so overall how long should your cv be
35,at this point again it depends if you're
35,somebody that's published a lot
35,it's going to be longer if you're
35,somebody that has
35,you know done a lot of research over the
35,years
35,both in undergrad and grad school
35,it's going to be longer if you're
35,somebody that's you know
35,pretty new that you didn't do a lot of
35,research really in undergrad
35,you haven't really published a lot it
35,may be short only half a page
35,the point is that you want to have it be
35,something like this where it's
35,nice and concise okay this is john this
35,is where he lives his contact
35,okay this is his high level summary of
35,himself
35,this is his education his experience so
35,far
35,these are his memberships awards his
35,abstracts his papers
35,and that they could clearly move down
35,the list
35,and see what it was that you were able
35,to accomplish
35,so i hope this was useful i know that
35,this is something that you're gonna
35,constantly be evolving your cv this is
35,something that isn't just written and
35,then it's just like
35,pieces added here or there as you move
35,through your career different things are
35,gonna be
35,you know they're going to become
35,important so maybe under your awards
35,like
35,best student publication is like a
35,really cool award like
35,i would like one of those like when i
35,was in grad school to win that kind of
35,an award
35,but obviously a pi that's been around
35,for 35 years
35,and has won all kinds of awards maybe
35,they might remove this to make space on
35,their cv they don't necessarily need
35,that anymore
35,likewise maybe you get to a point where
35,you're a pi and the techniques that you
35,know
35,don't really matter anymore because when
35,you send your cv out nobody cares
35,what techniques you could do because
35,you're not really at the bench anymore
35,um so i hope this was really helpful
35,to some of you out there that maybe have
35,been having trouble
35,drafting a kind of cv for you know
35,a more senior grad student this was kind
35,of a made up example it's been some time
35,since i was a more senior grad
35,student i don't really have a copy of
35,mine back then but
35,i think mine was pretty similar to this
35,kind of a layout and i think this is a
35,a common way of doing it and one that i
35,think it
35,logically makes sense and i think that
35,if a pi were to get something like this
35,they would
35,be able to fairly easily follow what it
35,is that you're talking about
35,so with that i'll catch you guys in the
35,next one bye
36,welcome back everybody so i just wanted
36,to drop in and say hi
36,i'm really excited to say that we've hit
36,500 subscribers actually we're a little
36,bit over now
36,um this is incredible when we first
36,started this channel i thought maybe i
36,would get
36,two or three subscribers the fact that
36,we have a group of 500 of us now
36,it blows my mind and the next big goal i
36,think that we should be hitting is
36,1 000 subscribers so with that said when
36,we do hit a thousand subscribers i do
36,want to do some sort of a giveaway
36,so be sure to leave a comment down below
36,of what you think we should do for that
36,giveaway
36,also make sure to drop a comment below
36,on some types of videos that you would
36,like to see upcoming i do have some
36,in the works some by myself some
36,interview style ones
36,but we have some good things in store
36,but as always
36,these videos are really for you guys so
36,please let me know the types of videos
36,that you want to see
36,and you know hopefully we can make those
36,work so with that
36,i'll catch you in the next one bye
37,welcome back everybody so today we got
37,another great video
37,we're going to be talking about the
37,postdoc years in personal finances
37,and how personal finances may play a
37,role
37,in somebody's decision to stay as a
37,postdoc versus leave and find a new
37,position in industry or
37,academia and this was a video that was
37,suggested
37,by a viewer so as always if there's
37,something that you really
37,want leave a comment below and i'll be
37,able to make videos about that
37,and help you guys out again these videos
37,are for you guys to try to help you guys
37,through different hardships that i dealt
37,with and that i faced
37,and as always if you liked the video
37,give it a thumbs up it'll help spread
37,this video out to more people
37,so i would like to make a video at some
37,point about
37,hardships financially that many of us
37,went through in grad
37,school or maybe some of you are still
37,going through in grad school
37,but this is a really difficult video to
37,make because depending on the country
37,that you're
37,in the circumstances whether you're
37,doing it abroad or
37,in country it's really hard to know
37,exactly how
37,your finances may change during grad
37,school
37,so what we're going to do first is start
37,with post-doc years and particularly
37,people in the united states doing a
37,postdoc
37,and i want to talk to you about my
37,experience and about what i've seen
37,other people go through and just
37,something to keep in mind
37,so to backtrack a little bit for those
37,of you that haven't
37,followed my videos for very long i grew
37,up in the midwestern united states i i
37,was originally from the chicago area i
37,went to school in michigan
37,and then for my phd i went to a smaller
37,school in springfield illinois
37,the university of southern illinois
37,university
37,and in springfield illinois
37,everything is really cheap so when i
37,first started grad school
37,my apartment was a two-bedroom two-bath
37,newly remodeled apartment that was like
37,a thousand square feet or thereabouts
37,a little over a thousand square feet
37,maybe and
37,it was only like seven hundred and
37,twenty dollars a month
37,and i think my my wife before we got
37,married was in an
37,another two bedroom apartment that was
37,even less it was only like
37,500 something dollars a month it was
37,really really cheap and so if you
37,live in a community like that that's
37,really
37,cheap yes you can be okay as a postdoc
37,with the salary that they earn
37,however the issue becomes when you move
37,to somewhere that has a much higher cost
37,of living so the issue for those of you
37,that are not familiar
37,with doing a postdoc in the united
37,states is that
37,most everyone is going to be doing their
37,postdoc off of
37,nih funding and the pay scale that
37,nih sets okay so what that means is the
37,nih says that
37,somebody with zero years experience so a
37,freshly graduated phd student that
37,starts a postdoc
37,should earn this much of a salary if you
37,have
37,one year you get a bump in your pay two
37,years you get a bump and so every year
37,you get a small bump in your pay but
37,it's it's barely anything it's it's
37,barely inflation
37,or it may not even be the same rate as
37,inflation
37,the issue with that is it's sort of a
37,national average and so you have some
37,places where
37,you know it it probably is okay some
37,places where you do
37,better than okay so where i was in
37,springfield if you were postdoc and you
37,were bringing in fifty thousand 000
37,a year for yourself that's pretty good
37,like you're okay
37,the problem is that a lot of us live in
37,really expensive places
37,and it's not enough money and so
37,another system that i think would be a
37,lot better is what happens when you
37,finish
37,medical school and you do residency in
37,the united states because there there is
37,some level of adjustment
37,based off of where you live and the cost
37,of living and how much you're going to
37,make during your residency
37,that seems more appropriate to me but
37,you know for us
37,phds we don't have that luxury so
37,when we moved from the
37,springfield area to boston because i
37,wanted to
37,do my post-doc at harvard medical school
37,we were in for a very rude awakening
37,where the cheapest apartments that
37,you're gonna find
37,are you know two thousand dollars um you
37,could spend three four five thousand
37,dollars on an apartment here
37,you could spend you know obviously way
37,more than that but
37,you know what i'm trying to get at is
37,that it gets very expensive very quick
37,same with child care so child care for
37,example in the midwest
37,very cheap you know you might spend a
37,few hundred bucks a month for daycare
37,here in boston for a newborn baby
37,daycare is about three thousand dollars
37,a month
37,so you could easily drop five six
37,thousand dollars a month
37,on just your apartment and on child care
37,and so let's just say that you spent
37,five thousand dollars a month so you
37,spent three thousand on
37,daycare and two thousand dollars a month
37,on
37,your apartment you know over the course
37,of a year that's sixty thousand dollars
37,and that's post tax money so that
37,doesn't even include money that's taken
37,out for taxes
37,now a new post doc is only making fifty
37,thousand dollars a year
37,so you don't even have enough money to
37,pay for daycare
37,and rent um so even if your
37,spouse picks up a you know another job
37,that you know they're working in the
37,boston area
37,yes you could do daycare and rent and
37,you could live very cheaply
37,but you're barely keeping your head
37,above water
37,and this is something that people really
37,just don't warn you about boston and
37,they really should
37,is that doing your postdoc at harvard
37,one of the most grueling things is being
37,able to afford living in boston which is
37,a very it's a city that if you don't
37,make a lot of money
37,you're gonna have a really hard time
37,living here the cost of living is just
37,so
37,outrageous um and what this
37,ends up doing is forcing people out
37,early from their postdoc so
37,just within the lab that i did my post
37,doc in
37,when i had joined there was somebody
37,that was there for their
37,their fourth year and they were getting
37,ready to submit a paper to
37,sell or sell metabolism at the time and
37,they decided that they were going to
37,leave and go back to their home country
37,and i remember talking to him
37,and i hadn't really been in boston for
37,that long and i asked him you know why
37,are you leaving like
37,you're in just such good shape like you
37,excel in everything that you do
37,you're gonna probably be able to get
37,this paper published in this super high
37,impact journal like
37,why are you leaving and he flat out told
37,me you know
37,my wife is a tutor part-time here but
37,between that and my my job we can't
37,afford everything every month and so
37,we've been slowly racking up credit card
37,debt
37,and i've gotten to the point where i've
37,just maxed out a couple credit cards and
37,don't really have room
37,to afford more and i'm scared to keep
37,piling on more debt and i think that
37,it's time that we head back
37,um i know another person in my lab who
37,came in a couple years before them and a
37,couple years before me
37,and he again was doing really well for
37,himself
37,in the lab but the last year in the lab
37,was really hard he had to send his wife
37,and his daughters back home to his home
37,country to go live there
37,because it was too expensive to be
37,living in boston and so he had to go
37,meet some different people on the
37,internet and try to
37,do some co-housing with some random
37,strangers on the internet while the rest
37,of his family
37,was back in his home country so i mean
37,just imagine that that you're
37,an adult you're married you have kids
37,you know
37,you want to be doing what's best for
37,them and being in a position where you
37,think
37,what's best is to have to send them back
37,home to their home country and then
37,you're living with some strangers i mean
37,i think in the end long term it'll be
37,the right decision and you know i
37,obviously would never question somebody
37,else's decision
37,um i personally would have such a hard
37,time being able to do that i don't know
37,that i would be able to just send my
37,wife and my son
37,back to another country and then go live
37,with some strangers i don't know if i'm
37,brave enough to do that um but
37,those are real hardships and and those
37,are just two people that i knew within
37,my own lab
37,now imagine all the different labs in
37,boston and how many people there are
37,that go through these hardships and i'm
37,sure
37,that there are people watching this
37,video that have gone through the same
37,thing where
37,whether it's grad school or postdoc that
37,you're just thinking to yourself
37,my gosh like i know that i want delayed
37,gratification
37,meaning that i know i'm gonna put off
37,having money in my 20s while i see my
37,friends having money in their 20s
37,because i know that in my 30s 40s 50s
37,i'm gonna be set either with job
37,security or being able to make a lot
37,more money
37,i'm okay with that kind of delayed
37,gratification but
37,this is just ridiculous that i can't
37,afford to live
37,um and that i have this advance
37,especially if you're a postdoc you have
37,this advanced degree
37,of a phd and you make you know not that
37,much over minimum wage
37,um you know it's tough
37,and so personally for me how much of a
37,role did it play so
37,when i started my um post doc here we
37,knew that my
37,well at the time actually we didn't know
37,that my wife was going to be landing a
37,postdoc position when i had to find
37,an apartment out here now luckily she
37,did find a postdoc position which did
37,help
37,increase our salary and eventually she
37,moved into industry which again really
37,helped our
37,position and let us move closer to the
37,city in a much
37,newer nicer apartment but at first when
37,we thought that it was just going to be
37,me
37,earning money we didn't know how long it
37,was going to take for her to
37,find a postdoc position which again
37,luckily was was very quickly
37,she actually had found one between the
37,time that
37,we signed the lease on our apartment and
37,then when we actually
37,moved so in between that that short time
37,she found one
37,um but what ended up happening was i had
37,to get an apartment
37,far away from the city and it was a
37,dumpy apartment
37,and it would take me an hour and a half
37,to drive to a train station and take the
37,train in and then walk
37,so an hour and a half to go to work i
37,would work a full day
37,and then an hour and a half to go back
37,every day back and forth back and forth
37,meanwhile
37,you know i had my wife at home my you
37,know son was only a few months old at
37,the time
37,it was very draining very tiring and
37,then you get home and then the baby's up
37,all night
37,um and it it's just not an ideal
37,situation
37,and then eventually you know my wife
37,ended up making some
37,some more money when she went to
37,industry and we were okay we were in a
37,good spot but what ended up happening
37,was
37,my son is now getting older where he
37,needed to
37,um start going to school and we wanted
37,to move to where there was a better
37,school district and we wanted to buy a
37,house we knew that we were going to stay
37,in boston we had made that decision um
37,both of us work in the sciences and and
37,when you're in science it makes more
37,sense to be in a city like boston which
37,is a science hub
37,and the schools here are great and we
37,think that culturally
37,it's it's good for my son and
37,we decided to buy a house and when we
37,started to look at a house and and
37,you know play around with how much it
37,was going to cost to have a house we
37,quickly realized that
37,you know we just couldn't cut it with me
37,being a
37,postdoc anymore and that i either needed
37,to be to be able to find a position
37,in academia or i needed to transition
37,over into industry
37,and as i started weighing options um
37,you know pros and cons of each one of
37,the big factors was that you just make a
37,lot more money in industry
37,and that we would be able to afford
37,housing a lot easier
37,and so because i wasn't able to stay
37,quite as long as i would have needed to
37,to be able to try to find
37,some kind of position in academia it was
37,a big driving force in my decision to go
37,into industry now that's not to say that
37,there aren't other reasons there are
37,obviously scientific reasons that i
37,wanted to go into industry so i had
37,personally felt that i had accomplished
37,a lot within
37,academia and i wanted to try my hand at
37,something new and see if i could also
37,accomplish things there
37,i did not want to have to write grants
37,for the rest of my life
37,um you know there's a lot of reasons why
37,i ultimately wanted to go into industry
37,but a big driving force was you know not
37,gonna lie
37,that you can't just stay a postdoc
37,forever and nowadays to become a faculty
37,member to be able to get
37,the publications you need the amount of
37,grants that you need the funding from
37,like a k01 award
37,you need to be there for five six seven
37,years and you it's just impossible
37,almost to do that
37,in boston unless you're really really
37,willing to sacrifice for
37,for that amount of time because you you
37,just don't have the money to be able to
37,live in an expensive
37,place like boston and i'm using boston
37,as an example because that's where i am
37,but
37,i do know that a lot of the big cities
37,it's the same way and it's not just
37,you know something specific to boston so
37,i think this video has gone on
37,um long enough but i do hope that this
37,helps and i do hope that people realize
37,that
37,they're not the only ones dealing with
37,financial hardship as they
37,you know venture through grad school and
37,especially through a post-doc as well
37,so with that if you enjoy this video
37,make sure to give it a thumbs up
37,and i'll catch you guys in the next one
37,bye
38,welcome back everybody ignore the
38,sunburn it's been a great weekend
38,outside playing with my family
38,but we're back for another video today
38,we're gonna give a quick video one
38,that's been asked a whole bunch in the
38,comments
38,and this is in reference to my giving a
38,postdoc
38,presentation video and one of the top
38,questions that i keep getting asked over
38,and over again
38,is something along the lines of i have
38,only 10 minutes to give a presentation
38,so how can i give a good presentation to
38,a postdoc
38,pi lab in only about 10 minutes
38,now you might think to yourself that the
38,shorter
38,the time that you have the easier it is
38,to give a talk
38,but actually that's not true the more
38,time that you have
38,the more time you have to really build
38,up your talk you could give a
38,very detailed um introduction
38,you could really go into the methodology
38,you could go into the results the
38,conclusions
38,future directions there's a lot that you
38,could do when you start getting up to a
38,30 45
38,60 minute talk but when you only have 10
38,minutes
38,that's not a lot that's like four slides
38,basically in 10 minutes
38,so if i was in those shoes and i was
38,asked to give a 10 minute talk
38,about the research that i had been doing
38,in grad school this is exactly how i
38,would go about answering this question
38,so the main things that you're going to
38,need is you're going to need an
38,introduction
38,results and conclusions those are the
38,three big things that you're going to
38,need
38,so for introduction what i would do
38,is very high level introduction so
38,i would start off with this is the big
38,question that's being
38,asked in the field you know how does
38,blank
38,impact blank and this is something that
38,hasn't been explored before and this is
38,exactly what we're going to go into i
38,would then
38,move into within either the same slide
38,or
38,in a subsequent slide giving some backup
38,background contacts as to why this
38,question is important
38,um depending on how you want to set up
38,your talk you could
38,switch that order so you could kind of
38,start with a broader context and then
38,narrow it in
38,or you could kind of start with a
38,somewhat narrow and then broaden it i
38,tend to do
38,um where i start very big and then
38,narrow it down into the specific
38,question but
38,either way can work it just depends on
38,the way that you
38,present and and how you find the most
38,comfortable
38,okay then what i would do is go into
38,results now for results
38,you can't go through an entire
38,dissertation worth of results in 10
38,minutes
38,it's impossible what you need to do is
38,you need to pick
38,the few things that you think are the
38,most important so maybe if you were to
38,think of
38,your work in terms of like one paper say
38,um you know maybe
38,you know uh image
38,one a one b one c and then if you go
38,into figure
38,three a and then figure four d
38,you know and you clumped all those
38,together that would tell your really
38,cohesive story
38,what you need to do is make sure that
38,what you're telling is a cohesive story
38,and that the um panels or graphs that
38,you're choosing to show
38,can be standalone meaning that you don't
38,need to have a ton of context to
38,understand
38,what each of them means so for example
38,if the last figure in your paper
38,you need to know what happened in you
38,know the last three figures
38,you may not want to show that piece of
38,data unless
38,it's something that's really highly
38,relevant that you're able to tie in
38,okay so what you need is some standalone
38,things that can kind of tie
38,be tied together to form one cohesive
38,story
38,and then conclusions again high level
38,that's the key to this is that it needs
38,to be high level if you go
38,too into the weeds you're never going to
38,be able to make that 10 minute cut off
38,and what you don't want to do and what i
38,often see people do when they have 10
38,minute talks
38,is they end up turning them into these
38,like really rapid fire things so what
38,they do is they take a 25 minute talk
38,and then try to cram it down into 10
38,minutes and you start just
38,rushing through and you're talking
38,really fast and you're just a b
38,c d next slide a b c d next slide and
38,what happens is everybody gets lost
38,before they could
38,really understand what you're saying
38,you've already moved on to the next
38,slide okay
38,and and that's really what you want to
38,avoid you want to get to a place where
38,you're not
38,rushing and talking like this and you're
38,just rushing rushing rushing you want to
38,get to a point
38,where you're nice and calm you're
38,relaxed you're able to talk through this
38,slide
38,and this slide and this leg like i said
38,10 minute presentation
38,and you're really giving high level
38,intro results conclusions
38,and you know a quick acknowledgement
38,you're you're really looking at
38,four sides four main slides at most
38,at most you really don't have time to be
38,going through
38,six seven eight nine main slides you
38,know an acknowledgement slide
38,that doesn't really count a title slide
38,that doesn't really count i'm talking
38,the the nuts and bolts of your talk so
38,again this is a much shorter video
38,but i wanted to get this out into a
38,video content and into a playlist just
38,because
38,this is something that just keeps being
38,asked over and over in the comments
38,but i am glad that that those of you
38,that have been doing this seem to be
38,on the right pace and and on the right
38,track and when people
38,kind of say this is kind of what i'm
38,going to do it sort of lines up pretty
38,well with the advice that i'm giving
38,here
38,so with that i'll catch you guys in the
38,next one
38,bye
39,welcome back everybody in today's video
39,we're going to be diving into a viewer
39,comment
39,which is which areas of research do i
39,think are sort of hot topics right now
39,things that can maybe have a bright
39,future in terms of securing grants
39,or a position as a pi that could publish
39,you know interesting papers
39,so we're going to dive into that if you
39,like this kind of content make sure to
39,give it a thumbs up it's really going to
39,help the channel grow
39,it'll show me you guys are interested
39,and i'll be able to keep making videos
39,for you guys
39,make sure to subscribe if you do it's
39,going to help the channel grow it's
39,going to help me know that you guys are
39,interested
39,and with that let's get into this i'm
39,going to preface this by saying that
39,the ones that i'm talking about today
39,are ones that i've observed
39,to be areas that science is just
39,generally interested in i'm going to say
39,that
39,not all of these are things that i
39,strongly believe in
39,but these are areas that i think have
39,room to grow and i'll explain what my
39,personal opinions are on each of these
39,the other thing that i'm going to do is
39,i'm going to let you know that
39,these are more for biological sciences
39,so if you're somebody that's more into
39,like
39,chemistry or physics obviously these
39,wouldn't apply
39,to you as much but i don't know enough
39,about those areas to
39,intelligently discuss those so keeping
39,in line with
39,more biomedical sciences what are
39,three areas that i think really have a
39,lot of room to grow
39,the first one that i think really has a
39,lot of room to grow is the microbiome
39,i think that over the last decade the
39,microbiome research has really taken off
39,quite a bit
39,but i still think that in general this
39,area of research is still in its infancy
39,i think that the idea of influencing
39,the microbes within our gut and how that
39,can then translate to different
39,metabolic health
39,disease states etc is a really
39,fascinating
39,idea this is something that has been
39,published a lot and has gotten really
39,high
39,impact publications including you know
39,your cell nature science
39,i think that there's a lot of funding
39,out there for microbiome and i think
39,there's a lot of
39,interesting avenues that you could take
39,it that haven't
39,yet been explored now the one
39,drawback that i kind of see to this and
39,why i personally am not the biggest fan
39,of microbiome
39,research is that at the moment it seems
39,like everything in
39,impacts the microbiome and the
39,microbiome impacts everything
39,it seems that you could do any little
39,small change and you're going to impact
39,every single phenotype out there within
39,the body
39,to me that makes the microbiome not for
39,one is
39,easy to understand because there's such
39,subtle differences can make such large
39,changes
39,the other thing is that when
39,the phenotype is so striking in that
39,manner it starts to become less
39,appealing to me
39,um but that that's just my personal
39,opinion i do think that there is
39,quite a bit of thirst out there to learn
39,more about the microbiome
39,so that's one area that i think really
39,has a chance to flourish
39,the second is evs or extracellular
39,vesicles
39,particularly exosomes now this is
39,something that for a while i was a
39,little bit skeptical on but the more i
39,dug into it the more that i feel like
39,this is an area that really has a lot of
39,room to run um so evs can be
39,important for a lot of things it could
39,be for
39,drug delivery it could be for how
39,different proteins are delivered to
39,cells first
39,you know inter-organ communication um
39,especially and in the endocrine field um
39,you talked about micro rnas getting
39,loaded into
39,exosomes and how they could influence
39,distal organs i mean that's an entire
39,you know huge field all on its own um
39,there's a lot that you could do with
39,exosomes and i think that
39,exosomes are more than just vesicles
39,released from the cell
39,carrying junk or just random things i
39,think there is some
39,rhyme or reason why specific things are
39,uploaded into exosomes when others
39,aren't
39,um and this is a field that i think for
39,a lot of reasons
39,especially for translatability you talk
39,about how you can hijack
39,the exosome machinery to help you know a
39,patient
39,you know in a grant application that's
39,that's huge right that's
39,that's kind of what you're going for um
39,and especially if you want to get a
39,faculty position at a medical school
39,that type of research is going to be
39,really interesting to them
39,and this is something that could easily
39,be carried out in patients because
39,you know in humans it's easy to get a
39,blood draw and so you could
39,do some good exosome research just from
39,the blood of patients so
39,i think this is another thing that's
39,interesting
39,number three on my list has to do
39,with all of the omics so for a long time
39,it was
39,um rna-seq that was like the big
39,transcriptomic data set that everybody
39,wanted
39,and then they've started to more
39,recently in the last decade or so move
39,into the more
39,um mass spec methods these have become
39,easier more high throughput and we're
39,able to get better proteomics
39,metabolomics
39,lipidomics but now they've really
39,started to
39,get fancy with it you know you have all
39,of your of course single cell sequencing
39,technologies
39,but you have you know not just
39,proteomics but phosphoproteomics and you
39,could build a whole
39,phosphophosphoproteome if you will
39,um these kinds of datasets are huge and
39,i
39,when i say getting into these what i
39,don't mean is like using it as just one
39,technique
39,i mean building a laboratory around this
39,type of technique and building a
39,laboratory that's really based around
39,helping others generate these meaningful
39,data
39,and for you to be able to get in and
39,develop the mass spec
39,or the sequencing technology to really
39,boost these technologies and move them
39,forward i think these are extremely
39,powerful technologies that give us so
39,much information
39,we don't even know how to handle it um i
39,mean
39,there are obviously packages in r that
39,we use you know dz
39,seek 2 or you know metabo analyst or
39,what have you
39,but in terms of like really utilizing
39,these i think we're starting to just get
39,into it now and i think that these are
39,things that
39,if you can develop the skill set and a
39,new technology
39,in this area that you know you can have
39,a lot of potential
39,in in the future and the last thing i
39,know i originally said we're going to do
39,three things but i think we're actually
39,going to do four
39,um is something that i think
39,hasn't been explored quite as much in
39,academia it's
39,more something in pharmaceuticals but i
39,think that the
39,academic labs that have done this have
39,really found success and that's drug
39,delivery
39,so i'll give you an example of at mit
39,there are some labs that work on lip and
39,nanoparticle
39,delivery which are just these small
39,lipid vesicles that are used to deliver
39,drugs and this is a really outstanding
39,technology that's been used
39,in pharmaceuticals and other labs and
39,academia want to collaborate to deliver
39,you know anything even to like aavs
39,right so there's a whole bunch of things
39,that you could do with these
39,you know lip banana particles or lmps
39,but there's in general the idea of how
39,do we deliver
39,different things whether it's again like
39,an aav for some kind of in vivo
39,you know modification um whether it's
39,some kind of a crispr protein
39,whether it's an si rna um
39,a biologic an antibody any kind of
39,delivery system that you could generate
39,is something that's really valuable and
39,important and if you could have a lab
39,that's based off of this kind of
39,bioengineering i think this is something
39,that can really have a bright future
39,so those are four areas that i think for
39,the most part
39,have a leg up at the moment not to say
39,that anything else
39,doesn't i think that you know you could
39,do anything you could do something in
39,virology you could do something
39,in embryology you know there's all kinds
39,of fields out there they all have their
39,place
39,they all have the ability to publish
39,high quality work
39,and good journals you know for you to be
39,able to get funding for you to be able
39,to find a faculty position
39,these are just four that off the cuff in
39,my experience from what i've seen
39,are ones that have the slight advantage
39,in terms of what people are looking to
39,get right now
39,um but that all can change so for
39,example the coven 19
39,pandemic i think really changed the way
39,that we're going to look at science
39,and i think that infectious disease
39,research
39,and vaccine research is going to get a
39,huge boost
39,um those areas you know maybe didn't
39,quite as much have that boost before but
39,now i think a lot of fun
39,funding is going to get funneled into
39,those efforts so these things are all
39,fluid and dynamic and they can always
39,change
39,so you know always be on the lookout for
39,the next best thing but also keep in
39,mind that these things do change
39,you know year to year they're not always
39,going to be the same so with that
39,i'll catch you guys in the next one bye
40,welcome back everybody
40,so there's a lot of new people to the
40,channel so in case you're new welcome
40,my name is justin i did my undergraduate
40,degree in microbiology
40,my phd in cell biology
40,i did a postdoc at harvard medical
40,school and now i work in
40,industry i've been all over the place
40,i've seen a lot of different things in
40,the scientific realm
40,and now i'm trying to you know give some
40,of my personal experience back to you
40,guys
40,as you make your journeys through grad
40,school and your postdoc
40,trying to help you find your way trying
40,to make the best of your situation
40,and try to really push your careers
40,forward
40,so if you don't mind smash the thumbs up
40,button if you
40,like this video make sure to subscribe i
40,know a lot of you watching
40,aren't subscribed but you keep coming
40,back for more so make sure to subscribe
40,so you don't miss any of the videos that
40,we put out
40,and with that let's get into today's
40,video what we're going to be talking
40,about
40,is how do you talk to your family and
40,friends
40,about your research about your
40,experience in grad school and postdoc
40,how do you
40,help them to understand what it is that
40,you're going through because
40,if you're anything like me your close
40,friends and your family
40,they went to maybe undergrad and then
40,that's it they don't know what it's like
40,going through grad school they've never
40,done scientific research
40,they've obviously never done a postdoc
40,so all of this is
40,new to them right so as you're learning
40,you need to help them learn
40,so the common thread that i'm going to
40,be
40,talking about here is making things
40,simple so there's an acronym kiss
40,k-i-s-s
40,means keep it simple stupid means don't
40,over complicate things keep it really
40,really simple
40,and that's going to be your best friend
40,and trying to explain all of this to
40,your friends and family
40,so let's start with how to describe your
40,research
40,and then we'll talk about grad school
40,and then we'll talk about a post-doc
40,so when you're talking about your
40,research
40,what you cannot do especially when it
40,comes to your research more than
40,anything else
40,is get into the weeds okay more than
40,likely they don't have a scientific
40,background
40,so you can't be talking about this
40,complex cell signaling you can't be
40,talking about this interaction what you
40,need to do is try to find
40,big common pictures so
40,i study this kind of cancer i study
40,hepatocell you know hcc hepatocellular
40,carcinoma
40,i study the effects of insulin
40,in the body i study circadian rhythm
40,keep it really simple then if they ask
40,follow-up questions about what it is
40,that you study
40,you can get into it so i study circadian
40,rhythm
40,oh that's really cool like so you study
40,how
40,people sleep and how they stay up no
40,what i study
40,is how x y or z
40,changes in the body over time as we're
40,you know awake and
40,sleeping and how that plays into our
40,metabolic health right something like
40,this
40,you can give follow-ups afterwards but
40,always start
40,very simply the other thing
40,is always be careful how you frame
40,things okay
40,don't try to oversell it don't try to
40,make it seem like you're
40,you know a world-class expert at
40,everything like you're obviously
40,studying a narrow field as all of us do
40,you know make sure that you stay within
40,that lane
40,and as you move forward
40,you'll have to start talking about what
40,you do in grad school so
40,there's a lot of common misconceptions
40,you're going to hear about grad school
40,so
40,a lot of it is like well you know you're
40,really just a student so can't you just
40,get like a job
40,after work to help pay for everything no
40,they don't understand that grad school
40,is like a full-time job and you're going
40,to be working 40 50
40,60 hours a week okay oh
40,so you know you you're in grad school
40,but you don't take class like how does
40,that work
40,again they don't understand that you
40,probably just take classes for the first
40,year maybe
40,two and then afterwards you have your
40,calls or prelims or
40,or however your department does it and
40,then from there you're just doing
40,research once you're all but
40,dissertation um
40,you know they don't understand why you
40,have to go into the lab on the weekends
40,or maybe why you have to stay late
40,um why this has impacted your dating
40,life or your
40,relationship with friends they don't
40,understand all of this so you need to
40,keep it really simple
40,okay this is what it means to go to grad
40,school i take classes for the first
40,couple years and then i have to take a
40,big test
40,and this test determines whether or not
40,i'm qualified
40,to continue on and get my phd and after
40,i do this test what i'm going to be
40,doing is doing research in a lab
40,on blank whatever it was that you
40,explained to them
40,and then i'm going to write a
40,dissertation on it and then there's a
40,lot of other things that go into it
40,right
40,so i maybe have
40,to work as a teaching assistant and i
40,have to teach you know undergrad
40,classes or i have to
40,go to these different conferences and so
40,i have to travel around the country
40,you know there's a lot of papers that i
40,have to read which is why i have a stack
40,of papers
40,up to the ceiling you know you can break
40,it down really simple and help them to
40,understand because you got to remember
40,unless you've gone through grad school
40,your experience with school is strictly
40,like what you had in undergrad
40,it's you take x amount of credits you do
40,classes x y and z if you get a good
40,grade then you can pass
40,and move on right so it's really easy to
40,say okay if i take my
40,12 credits a semester or 15 credits a
40,semester whatever it is
40,you know then at the end of four years
40,i'll have enough to graduate
40,there isn't this when will you graduate
40,i don't know
40,it depends when my pi and my committee
40,are going to let me graduate you know
40,that kind of
40,thing doesn't exist in undergrad they
40,don't under they can't wrap their mind
40,around what that means how can you not
40,know when you're going to be graduating
40,um you know how could classes not be
40,that important well because
40,you know in your phd you basically study
40,hard and you do well and if you don't
40,you know
40,they kick you out and so it's not really
40,about getting straight a's it's about
40,how can i maintain the gpa that i need
40,to
40,stay in the program and what's more
40,important is getting my research done
40,and publishing
40,and that's what's going to get me a
40,position as a as a postdoc
40,and then that's the next one is
40,explaining what is a post-doc
40,so actually with my family what i found
40,was that
40,explaining my research was hard at first
40,because what i tried to do was
40,over explain i tried to go too in depth
40,in what it was that i was doing
40,and once i realized that that wasn't
40,helping and i dialed it back a little
40,bit
40,then i could see the wheels turning and
40,like okay they understand
40,kind of what it is that i'm researching
40,when it came to grad
40,school it was a lot easier to explain
40,because as i was learning it i was also
40,explaining to them okay like
40,yeah there isn't a set time course that
40,you're in grad school and this is what
40,a qualifying exam is and this is like
40,what it takes to write a dissertation
40,you know
40,those kinds of things as i learned them
40,was able to communicate those back to my
40,family and it made it a little bit
40,easier
40,the one that really i had a hard time
40,with with my family and with other
40,friends and
40,when my parents you know maybe try to
40,explain it to their friends
40,was what a post-doc is
40,and the reason that it was really hard
40,is because
40,you're not in grad school anymore so
40,you're not really a student
40,but you're not really working full-time
40,it's a transient position
40,and it's not a thing that is um
40,something that someone's familiar with
40,you're not a scientist or you're not a
40,professor
40,you're kind of this like weird in
40,between stage
40,and what i found worked well is
40,explaining that it was sort of like
40,residency for doctors except it's first
40,scientists
40,so it's the same thing it's like being a
40,scientist in training you work
40,underneath a professor and you train how
40,to be a scientist
40,that was the best way that i could
40,explain it
40,um but there will be a lot of questions
40,about like well you have this degree
40,why are you only making forty thousand
40,dollars a year actually i think that the
40,nih minimum is higher than that it's
40,like 50 some thousand but still like why
40,are you like making no money
40,um if you're like in this in between
40,position why are you working 100 hours a
40,week
40,there's there's all these kinds of
40,questions that you're to have to fill in
40,but again just keep it simple you
40,walk them through okay i have my degree
40,and basically what a phd
40,degree means is that i've learned how to
40,work the scientific method to answer
40,a scientific question but now what i'm
40,going to do is under the supervision of
40,a different
40,professor is i'm going to learn to
40,perfect it i'm going to learn how to
40,address a new question
40,and use these new skills that i've
40,developed
40,to answer something new publish
40,something new
40,and get some funding to be able to start
40,my own lab or you know after i've
40,developed these skills out a little bit
40,more i'll move over to industry or maybe
40,i'll go work for the government
40,you know and like the fda or something
40,um
40,this is kind of what you need to do to
40,explain to them but i definitely have
40,found that the postdoc
40,was the hardest one to explain but again
40,i think that if you just explain it it's
40,like
40,it's sort of like how a doctor after
40,medical school goes to residency it's
40,the same thing
40,a scientist has to go through a postdoc
40,and it's just a supervised period of
40,research is what it is
40,and if you can explain it that way and
40,break it down i think you'll have a
40,little bit better of a time
40,so i kind of hope this helps a little
40,bit i mean if you have any questions
40,about any of this
40,make sure to leave it down in the
40,comment section below i know that this
40,was something that i struggled with for
40,a while through most of
40,the time that i was working until i
40,finally moved and became a scientist
40,in industry and even now they still
40,don't quite know what it is that i do
40,as a scientist but at least they have an
40,idea of like i'm a scientist and that's
40,a little bit easier to explain to people
40,um again if there's any other video
40,suggestions make sure to leave them down
40,in the comment section below i probably
40,should have mentioned this at the
40,beginning of the video with all the new
40,subscribers is
40,i really enjoy answering viewer
40,questions that come in the comments
40,section so
40,either i'll answer them in the comment
40,section or if it's something that i
40,think is
40,worth a video i'll make a whole video on
40,it so make sure to always leave any of
40,your questions in the comment section
40,below
40,with that i'll catch you guys in the
40,next one bye
41,welcome back everybody so today we're
41,gonna do part one of a two-part video on
41,networking
41,so if you like this content make sure to
41,like subscribe
41,it's really gonna help me show that the
41,channel is doing well and that you guys
41,are enjoying the content i'm putting out
41,if you have any viewer questions make
41,sure to leave them in the comment
41,section down below
41,i always try to read them and respond to
41,every comment and
41,most of the comments i end up actually
41,making a video about
41,so make sure to leave a comment down
41,below so today we're going to get into
41,networking now today we're going to be
41,talking about an
41,overview of networking and why it's
41,important and we're going to talk about
41,networking within your you know academic
41,institute
41,i'm going to do a second video
41,specifically designed
41,towards networking at a conference now
41,both of these
41,have very similar skill sets and reasons
41,why you're going to want to do it but
41,they are a little bit different so i
41,decided to split it up into two videos
41,so we don't have just one
41,super mega long video now
41,networking unlike in the business world
41,in science networking is sort of it's
41,like a dirty word right
41,you don't want to think about networking
41,what a lot of people say is that they
41,want their science to stand on its own
41,that let the data speak for itself and
41,there's a good and bad to that so
41,obviously the good in that is you know
41,when
41,when i produce data what i want is for
41,people to look at my data
41,and to be able to understand what i
41,presented and
41,or wrote about and published you know
41,whatever it might be
41,i want them to understand that data and
41,i want them to feel like okay
41,this is a meaningful thing i believe
41,this data
41,it makes sense to me and i think that it
41,moved
41,a particular field forward that is what
41,you would like you want your data to
41,stand
41,for itself the problem is you need a
41,spokesperson for your data
41,and you're the only person that's going
41,to be that spokesperson
41,so you need to be able to get up and be
41,a little bit of a salesman or a woman
41,and let them know why your data is
41,important
41,the other thing is that you need to make
41,connections because
41,although you could have great data if
41,you don't know the right people you're
41,never going to get your data out there
41,and when you want to find new positions
41,you're going to have a hard time if you
41,don't have a network built up
41,and it even starts with small things
41,like needing a letter of recommendation
41,so let's dive into this let's talk about
41,what networking really is what
41,networking
41,isn't and how you can use
41,people within your institute to help
41,advance your career
41,again we'll get into you know people
41,outside of your institute in the next
41,video but let's start small so what
41,is and isn't networking networking is
41,basically
41,the ability to gain professional
41,relationships
41,so just like when you go out and you
41,make friends in
41,school college
41,you know on a sports team in a music
41,band wherever you are
41,it's the same idea is you want to start
41,adding professional relationships and
41,there are
41,many different kinds of professional
41,relationships that you could add
41,there are peers so if you're a graduate
41,student or a postdoc
41,adding people that are grad students and
41,postdoc to that little bucket
41,of peers they could be
41,your pi they could be other
41,you know um professionals within the
41,department so maybe somebody on your
41,thesis committee
41,or a pi that you get to know well within
41,the department that's you know
41,two labs over and you see them every day
41,and you talk
41,what networking is not is
41,um like a fake connection of like
41,well i see this person every day and i
41,say hi to them and
41,so when the time comes i'm going to ask
41,them for a letter of recommendation
41,because they are going to know nothing
41,about you and they're not going to be
41,able to give you
41,a recommendation letter you need to find
41,people that you truly truly identify
41,with and you get to know well
41,and i'm going to give you examples of
41,people that i used as
41,you know or what i consider good
41,core parts of my professional network
41,now the people that are at your
41,university are going to
41,be fundamental in a couple of things the
41,first
41,is that likely they're in a somewhat
41,similar
41,field to you or one that you may want to
41,be in so they may know people that are
41,going to be hiring for postdocs
41,they may know people that work in
41,industry that can help you get into
41,industry
41,you know they're going to be the
41,foundation of giving you ideas of who
41,you could talk to
41,the next thing is that they're going to
41,be able to help greatly with letters of
41,recommendation
41,and let me tell you the letters of
41,recommendation are
41,really really important and
41,even if you know somebody just generally
41,the people are going to know
41,who who knows you superficially versus
41,who really knows you
41,so if they write a general letter you
41,know john
41,smith is a student in our department
41,and he seems to be intelligent and hard
41,working
41,and you know they don't really go in
41,depth they're gonna know
41,the individual reading is gonna know
41,that they just know you on a superficial
41,level that
41,you don't really know that person and
41,they don't know you
41,it's different if they say jane doe
41,has been coming and presenting at this
41,group data meeting every
41,week they always ask intelligent
41,questions
41,they've had this and this breakthrough
41,in their research that seems
41,advanced for someone at their peer level
41,you know these types of things that when
41,they really get to know you that's going
41,to stand out as like
41,wow this person knows the individual
41,they're writing about and that this
41,individual
41,really is somebody worth knowing
41,so the people that i had as my core
41,network in a graduate school and then
41,i'll talk about what i had
41,in my postdoc but in my graduate school
41,obviously my pi
41,he was obviously someone that i always
41,had as a letter of recommendation
41,there was a professor in the adjacent
41,department so there were two departments
41,that worked very close with each other
41,um i was in like the cell biology
41,department and then there was a farm
41,department that was right next to ours
41,there was a the person that was in
41,charge of the farm department served on
41,most of my stuff and i really got to
41,know her well she had a lot of
41,interaction with our department
41,and i got to know her really well
41,through classes and then subsequently
41,our lab collaborated with theirs a lot
41,and i was able to provide
41,feedback to their lab on direction of
41,certain aspects of techniques that they
41,weren't as familiar with so i really got
41,to know her well then
41,and she ended up being on my committee
41,then my department chair i got to know
41,him really well
41,i made sure that i always always always
41,tried to network with him
41,every single week if we had some kind of
41,a you know department meeting i
41,always went out of my way to say hi to
41,him talk to him
41,we talked about his lab we talked about
41,my lab i mean
41,i even knew his who his kids were
41,um you know over time got to learn about
41,his family history and
41,his kids and his wife and you know got
41,to know you know those personal details
41,but that's good
41,in terms of my peer group probably the
41,one that i am the closest with was
41,obviously the grad student that was the
41,senior grad
41,student within my department um
41,she was somebody that even to this day
41,like i still
41,network with her and keep in touch but
41,there are
41,others that were within my department
41,that i got to know well
41,and was able to um
41,use them in some ways not in in a bad
41,way but
41,you know they helped to introduce me to
41,different people down the road
41,and then obviously my wife who's been in
41,a video that we've made before and i'm
41,gonna have her come back again
41,and she's a great person to network with
41,because she was
41,always a little bit ahead of me within
41,my career so
41,she defended her dissertation before me
41,she started a postdoc before me she
41,moved to industry before me so i was
41,able to
41,emulate exactly what she did each step
41,of the way
41,and that was honestly very very helpful
41,when i went to my post doc the core that
41,i had built up was
41,a little bit more narrowed down
41,obviously my pi at the time
41,but there was a big group data meeting
41,that we would always go to every week
41,every friday morning and the postdocs
41,from about three or four labs would
41,rotate
41,presenting and within there there were a
41,few people that i got to know really
41,well that were faculty members
41,and they all were able to help introduce
41,me
41,to different people even one introduced
41,me to one of the csos at
41,pfizer um so you really
41,don't know who some of these pis know
41,until you know you ask
41,and i built great relationships with
41,them over the course of three years
41,and they were willing to help out when
41,the time came
41,the other people that i knew really well
41,that helped
41,to give me a little bit of a boost and
41,get to know people
41,within industry when i wanted to go to
41,industry was we had a
41,fellows council which was just a group
41,of 10 fellows or soul that would
41,organize
41,happy hours and and this kind of stuff
41,for the
41,the postdocs within the institute that i
41,was at
41,and there's two pis that served on this
41,committee and i got to know them really
41,really well and both of them were able
41,to connect me with
41,former postdocs that had since moved
41,into industry
41,and that was really helpful when i was
41,beginning my job search trying to move
41,into industry
41,so i hope this kind of gives you a
41,little bit of an idea
41,and you would be surprised how fast you
41,go from grad student to postdoc
41,into you know higher levels i already
41,have
41,um several post docs that i knew
41,from you know just a couple years ago
41,that have already asked me
41,i'm interested at this position in your
41,company do you think you could hook me
41,up with whoever
41,is hiring or you know i'm applying for
41,a position as a faculty member could you
41,serve as one of my
41,you know peer references because they
41,need references from pi's but they also
41,need peer references
41,so can you be a peer reference for me um
41,you know it's very quick that these
41,things happen and
41,you know you need to be ready for it
41,that the people that you thought were
41,just peers and just grad students
41,you know not that long into the future
41,they're going to be the pis and they're
41,going to be the ones that you need to
41,network with so it's not just about
41,getting to know the
41,pis although at this stage it is
41,important but you also need to start
41,really
41,building out that peer network
41,especially if you're going to be staying
41,within one field knowing your peers
41,within that
41,field so i hope this video was helpful
41,again
41,we're going to have part two coming out
41,later and that's going to be about
41,networking at conferences
41,but with that i always want to say bye
41,and i'll catch you in the next one
42,welcome back everybody so today we're
42,gonna pick up with part two of our
42,two-part series on
42,networking if you haven't seen the first
42,part i recommend going and checking that
42,out
42,it's all about networking within your
42,actual institution but today we're going
42,to talk about the trickier part
42,which is actually getting out at for
42,example a conference and networking and
42,building relationships
42,so we're going to start off by focusing
42,on networking as a graduate student or
42,postdoc
42,with people that are currently pi so
42,people that are more senior to you and
42,at the end we'll get into a little bit
42,about networking with your peers
42,but i think networking with your peers
42,tends to be a little bit easier and uses
42,some of the same tropes as
42,what you're going to be doing when
42,you're trying to network with somebody
42,that's a pi
42,so as always if you like this video make
42,sure to give it a thumbs up
42,we're trying to continue growing the
42,channel it really helps show that you
42,guys are interested in these videos that
42,i'm making it it helps
42,you know give me support so give it a
42,thumbs up if you like these videos
42,subscribe
42,we're at 600 subscribers already we're
42,working towards that
42,uh 1000 subscriber milestones so let's
42,keep them rolling so with that
42,let's get into the video so
42,the first thing that you're going to
42,need to do is you're going to need to
42,work on your elevator pitch
42,okay so what is an elevator pitch if
42,you're not familiar with that
42,that is your 15 second
42,pitch or you know self-representation
42,that you would give
42,for example if you're in an elevator so
42,if you got stuck with someone in the
42,elevator
42,and you had to tell them exactly what
42,your research was about for
42,that one elevator ride that you know one
42,minute
42,or so what would you tell them now when
42,i was in grad school i personally was
42,not very good at giving an elevator
42,pitch
42,i was someone that would just drag it on
42,and i wasn't very good at condensing
42,down
42,how to give an elevator pitch when i
42,went into my postdoc
42,however we actually did a few workshops
42,where a lot of the postdocs would get
42,together and we would practice our
42,elevator pitches with each other and
42,even a couple pis would come in and
42,listen
42,and give constructive feedback because
42,this is actually more important than you
42,think
42,when you're at a conference everybody's
42,busy they're shuffling around they're
42,trying to get from one talk to the next
42,there's this person that they haven't
42,seen in five years that wants to talk to
42,them there's this old grand student that
42,wants to talk to them
42,um you know maybe they have a talk they
42,have to give you have to be able to
42,catch their attention
42,very very quickly you have about 30
42,seconds to a minute to drill into
42,somebody
42,you know why they should spend time
42,talking to you
42,so practice your elevator pitch if you
42,guys don't already do this with other
42,grad students and postdocs get together
42,and practice with each other like giving
42,each other elevator pitches
42,it really comes in handy if you really
42,want to know more about
42,the art of doing this let me know in the
42,comments below and i can make a whole
42,video on how to give an elevator pitch
42,now once you have that the next thing
42,that you're going to need is to
42,be prepared in case they want for
42,example your cv
42,in case they want a business card have
42,those things ready to go i think that
42,it's always a good idea if you're going
42,to a conference
42,to have your business cards and your cv
42,ready have a few copies ready in case
42,you need it
42,of both of them now
42,the next thing that you're going to need
42,to do after you've kind of
42,prepared your elevator pitch and you've
42,gathered your business cards and your cv
42,and everything is when you get to the
42,conference
42,you know even before but especially at
42,the conferences you're gonna have to
42,have that
42,personal talk in the mirror this is by
42,far
42,the hardest thing and something that is
42,very hard
42,for me to try to coach through on just a
42,video but
42,you need to start working on building up
42,the courage
42,to go up to someone and talk to them and
42,this is really difficult
42,um even for people that are outgoing
42,it's hard
42,to go up to somebody and you know
42,a total stranger that you don't know
42,especially if they're like a well-known
42,pi
42,it can be very intimidating to go up to
42,them and start a conversation
42,you need to start practicing in front of
42,the mirror
42,whether that's the elevator pitch
42,whether you're practicing your
42,introduction
42,you need to be able to start getting
42,yourself amped up
42,ready to go and and building that
42,confidence okay
42,there's not a lot of pis out there that
42,are going to be mean and just kind of
42,steer you away um and most likely if
42,somebody
42,you know did kind of brush you a little
42,bit and and they try to just run off
42,it's probably because they're really
42,busy honestly they're not trying to be
42,rude would be my guess
42,um so don't worry about you know some
42,sort of rejection or that they're not
42,interested in you
42,especially if you're younger a lot of
42,them will take interest and they'll take
42,note that somebody younger is trying to
42,talk to them and they and they
42,find that admirable they'll enjoy that
42,but
42,practice what you're going to say and
42,start building up that courage
42,so when the moment comes you're ready to
42,act
42,now the next thing that you're going to
42,do is actually
42,being at the conference you need to
42,identify who you're going to talk to
42,some of it may be people that you
42,identified beforehand that you've looked
42,and you've said oh this is someone i've
42,read their papers i'm familiar with them
42,and if i run into them
42,you know and i get a chance i want to
42,introduce myself i'm interested in the
42,research that they do
42,some of it may be a person that your pi
42,works with and you want to get to know
42,them so you could go up to them and
42,introduce yourself and be like i'm you
42,know
42,so and so and you know i work in
42,so-and-so's lab
42,you know you guys collaborate i've seen
42,a lot of what you do i just wanted to go
42,up and introduce myself
42,as the you know senior grad student in
42,the lab
42,you know that's another way that you
42,could do it and then there's also times
42,where you may just be sitting in the
42,audience and you want to go up to
42,someone because you just
42,loved what they talked about and this
42,actually happened to me
42,so i was at a conference
42,a smaller biology of aging conference in
42,texas
42,and there was somebody that was from the
42,harvard
42,school of public health that was giving
42,a talk and i just
42,loved what he was talking about i had
42,never even heard of this individual
42,before the conference but i sat down
42,with him and i asked him a question and
42,i just said hey you know i saw your talk
42,like
42,what do you think about this and it was
42,one of those kinds of questions i
42,i can't recall anymore it was his years
42,ago what i can't remember what the exact
42,question was but it was something that
42,you would maybe
42,ask um you know in the q a after a talk
42,but
42,it was a very short q a i didn't get a
42,chance to ask
42,i mean he was very nice he answered the
42,question and we spent some time talking
42,and
42,next thing you know i gave an oral
42,presentation so he later followed up
42,with me and asked me a couple of
42,questions and
42,later down the line we sat down next to
42,each other and had a couple drinks and
42,shared back and forth our ideas on
42,something and he said you know i want to
42,start up a project kind of similar to
42,some of the stuff you've been doing what
42,do you think about this
42,and we talked and discussed and it later
42,down the road i actually
42,ended up applying for a postdoc position
42,in his lab him and i kept in touch in
42,grad school and i kind of
42,helped connect him with the pi that i
42,was working with and
42,they collaborated on a project that was
42,published in cell metabolism
42,and and things worked out really well um
42,i didn't end up going to his lap but
42,i did make that connection and there are
42,several different pis that i've met over
42,the years
42,going and talking and networking and
42,trying to build my brand okay
42,that's the most important thing with
42,networking is it's not a dirty word
42,it's it's um something you need to do
42,you need to build your personal brand
42,and that is going to help you when it
42,comes to trying to secure jobs to secure
42,grants to publish papers
42,you need people within your field
42,to know who you are the only way that's
42,going to happen is by going out there
42,you know having the courage to say hi
42,i'm so and so
42,and striking up a conversation if you
42,don't do that
42,your name will never get out there and
42,it's going to be very difficult for you
42,science is a very very social
42,discipline and if you're not able to
42,socialize it's going to be
42,really really hard to network and it's
42,going to be really hard to succeed
42,as a scientist you can have the best
42,ideas in the world but if you can't get
42,them out there
42,they're kind of meaningless okay now
42,in terms of networking with your peers
42,this is a little easier again
42,you have to have the courage right
42,however don't forget that your peers are
42,in the same boat as you
42,right so if you're at a conference it
42,may be your first conference it may also
42,be their first conference or you know
42,they're younger and they're not
42,as comfortable talking to pis maybe they
42,want to talk to somebody of their own
42,age
42,they also want to network with people
42,their own age
42,go walk around to the the posters
42,you know if you find an interesting
42,poster strike up a conversation with
42,somebody
42,show some interest you know that's the
42,biggest thing when you're talking to
42,people whether it's a pi
42,or a grad student a postdoc whoever show
42,interest in what they're doing if you
42,show interest in what they're doing
42,it's going to make such a difference
42,you're going to catch them
42,everybody wants to talk about their work
42,um that's just the reality everybody's
42,interested in what they do and everyone
42,wants to share their work
42,that's the best advice that i could give
42,when trying to network is
42,you know one you need to be able to sell
42,yourself with a good elevator pitch and
42,two you need to be able to show interest
42,in what others are doing
42,if you do those two things well you're
42,gonna
42,have a good chance of networking so i
42,think that this video has gone on
42,long enough i think that these are some
42,of the basic things that you need for
42,networking if you want to know more
42,about how to make an elevator pitch or
42,something more specific with networking
42,let me know and i'm happy to
42,make a video like that um you know
42,there's a lot of other ways that you can
42,network for example linkedin maybe you
42,want to see a video about how to
42,create you know a good linkedin profile
42,or things too or to not put into that
42,researchgate is another one there are
42,ways to network however i think one of
42,the best ways is at conferences and
42,that's why i kind of wanted to make this
42,specific video
42,so with that i'll catch you guys in the
42,next one again don't forget to like if
42,you
42,thought this was a good a good video
42,make sure to subscribe
42,uh really helps to show that you know
42,you guys are supporting the channel
42,and uh yeah i'll catch you guys in the
42,next one bye
43,welcome back everybody today we're going
43,to get into a good video which is
43,two separate apps that i use for
43,keeping organized during my post doc
43,during my grad school years
43,now these are two apps that are on an
43,ipad and i will admit that these apps
43,both of them cost money i think about
43,like
43,eight nine dollars but i think that it's
43,well worth it
43,um these really helped me a lot with
43,taking notes
43,organizing pdfs annotating pdfs
43,and this is two of the things that
43,during grad school and during your
43,postdoc you're going to do the most is
43,you're going to be taking notes
43,and you're going to be reading papers
43,and this is what i found helped me when
43,i had first started grad school
43,i just had stacks of papers piled up on
43,my desk and i quickly realized that this
43,was just not a tenable situation
43,and that i needed to find some kind of
43,an electronic way to
43,you know stay sane and i did that
43,through an ipad now
43,both of these apps happen to have apps
43,that work on a mac if you have a mac
43,but if you have a pc there's a lot of
43,good apps out there that you could use
43,um you know if you have the windows 360
43,suite
43,365 suite you know you have things like
43,onenote
43,and you know i could give other
43,recommendations but today i just wanted
43,to focus on the two apps that i've used
43,personally that i think are
43,just fantastic and i'll also throw in an
43,honorable mention as well
43,so the first one i'm going to start with
43,is one called good notes
43,now good notes is one that's really
43,evolved a lot and again
43,you could get this for the mac for the
43,iphone and for the ipad but really it's
43,designed for the ipad
43,and works well if you have an apple
43,pencil to go with it
43,and as you can see there's a lot of
43,different
43,ways that you could take notes i really
43,like
43,the always find what you wrote so it has
43,really good
43,handwriting recognition so one of the
43,things that always put me off about
43,taking hand notes on paper was that
43,there was no way to then go back and
43,find what i had written about so
43,you know if i was taking notes and i
43,wanted to search by keyword like
43,cell biology or mitochondria
43,there was no way to actually search for
43,that but with good notes they actually
43,have a really good
43,search engine so you could do a mixture
43,of handwriting but i think
43,in here they probably will show it
43,somewhere you also can type if you
43,really wanted to type your notes but
43,it's good for drawing
43,they i really like how they stack
43,everything in these notebooks
43,so unlike some other note-taking apps
43,which are more just like subfolders i
43,like hear how they organize things by
43,notebook so it was really
43,easy for me to make a notebook that was
43,designed for
43,you know cell biology you know whatever
43,the course number was and then i could
43,take all of my notes and sell biology
43,and organize them by sections again they
43,sync across all of your devices which is
43,good
43,and overall i just thought this was a
43,really fantastic app
43,now i'm also going to give an honorable
43,mention to another app which is
43,notability
43,notability is very similar to goodnotes
43,and in fact
43,if you really want to get deep dives
43,into either of these
43,there's so many videos on youtube that
43,go
43,over really in depth how to use each one
43,and maximize
43,each one that's not really the point of
43,this video it's more just to bring
43,awareness of these apps to you guys
43,since i think that these are really
43,awesome tools
43,for capturing notes and for organizing
43,pdfs
43,now the one thing that is really good
43,about notability and i'm not sure if
43,they
43,have it here so here you could see that
43,they did like
43,an illustration drawing and then they
43,also had some typing in here
43,so it's good if you want to do both the
43,one thing that people
43,do seem to really like about notability
43,is that
43,you can record lectures so what you
43,could do is if you're sitting in your
43,biochemistry class you could start a
43,recording
43,and take notes and notability and you
43,could even
43,import into good notes or notability
43,pdfs
43,so you could use these as ways to
43,organize and annotate pdfs if you would
43,like
43,but i do know that there were other kids
43,or
43,adults i should say in my in my you know
43,phd class that would
43,import the powerpoint as a pdf into
43,notability they would take notes on
43,their ipad
43,and the awesome thing about it was that
43,when you went back home you could hit
43,play and it would literally play back
43,the lecture for you
43,and as it was playing back in real time
43,it would show you where you were taking
43,notes
43,so if you ever got stuck in your like
43,i'm not sure why i was taking notes on
43,this one specific thing it seemed
43,important at the time but now like
43,i can't really remember what the
43,professor was talking about
43,you could go back and listen to that and
43,that's really the main
43,reason i wanted to give notability like
43,a shout out i personally used goodnotes
43,but that one feature alone i think for a
43,lot of people is going to be a selling
43,point and something that you would want
43,to look into notability about
43,now i mentioned that for both of these
43,that you can go ahead
43,and um you can
43,import pdfs and so why didn't i use
43,either of these to do pdfs
43,uh the main reason is because there is
43,this app
43,called pdf expert now
43,pdf expert is just
43,the pin ultimate pdf app in my opinion
43,if you're in the apple ecosystem so if
43,you have an iphone
43,you can use it but really it's made for
43,ipad and for the mac
43,the mac version is really expensive but
43,the ipad version for not that much
43,money has everything that you could want
43,so you could of course
43,annotate your pdfs which is really great
43,so you could obviously do your markers
43,pens you can make
43,notes there's annotation
43,summaries there's table of contents
43,there's editing pdf so if you ever
43,needed to edit a pdf
43,there's all kinds of things merging pdfs
43,extracting pages
43,you could protect sensitive data like
43,redacting or put
43,passwords on it you could fill out pdf
43,similar to what you do in adobe acrobat
43,customize all the way that you you want
43,it to work
43,and and honestly i mainly use it
43,for the reading experience
43,and i use it for the annotations being
43,as in
43,you know one of the big things i do is
43,read scientific literature
43,and the ipad is a perfect size it's like
43,holding a piece of paper but it's a
43,tablet and you could just
43,infinitely read paper after paper on
43,them it's like one of the best things
43,ever
43,um but honestly i also do use
43,i don't do the pdf editing but i do use
43,the things like redacting merging pdfs
43,extracting pages
43,and i do do a lot of pdf filling so i do
43,use my ipad
43,and pdf expert a lot for filling out
43,things you know for
43,work or for personal things whenever i
43,need to fill things out it's really easy
43,to do on the ipad
43,and for putting signatures onto things
43,but
43,i think that if you were to get either
43,good notes or notability and then pdf
43,expert i think that you're well on your
43,way and it's worth spending the
43,twenty dollars to do it and have just
43,infinite control
43,over how you organize your app um your
43,pdfs and your notes now again
43,this works really really well if you're
43,in the apple ecosystem and you have an
43,ipad and i realize that not everybody
43,does
43,especially if you're in graduate school
43,they do cost money
43,um so if you want i can make a follow-up
43,video to this where i go over some
43,alternatives that are more
43,pc friendly or something that you would
43,maybe get on a pc or on
43,on your mac that aren't necessarily for
43,an ipad
43,um so if that's something that you're
43,interested in let me know in the
43,comments down below
43,but with that i'm gonna wrap this one up
43,and i'll catch you guys in the next one
43,bye
44,welcome back everybody so today we have
44,another viewer comment that we're going
44,to answer
44,and i'll say that if you have any
44,questions
44,make sure to leave them in the comments
44,below we've been answering a lot of
44,questions both
44,in the comment section and in videos
44,from individuals that have really good
44,questions so if you have questions
44,be sure to ask them i'm sure there are
44,others out there that have the same
44,question
44,today the question is going to be
44,focused on what to do in terms of
44,leaving labs so specifically
44,if you have a good relationship with
44,your current pi doing a postdoc but you
44,feel like
44,you have this new opportunity that
44,opened up and you could leave
44,from that lab to move over to a new lab
44,is it worth doing is it okay to do how
44,do you do it
44,and what i'm going to do is get to that
44,but first what i want to do is
44,discuss in general leaving labs in a
44,toxic situation because i think that
44,that's something that people are going
44,to find themselves in
44,you know i'm not sure how many of you
44,have found yourself in this kind of a
44,situation where you have a really toxic
44,pi
44,and you've either thought about leaving
44,or you did actually leave
44,let me know in the comments down below
44,so
44,if you're in grad school and you have a
44,toxic pi
44,this is probably the worst situation
44,worse than a
44,when you're doing your postdoc because
44,you're kind of tethered to that
44,department
44,so it's hard to leave and just go
44,somewhere else so you kind of have
44,a couple options really which is trying
44,to fix the situation
44,leaving to a pi you know that's in the
44,department that's a different pi
44,or just leaving the department all
44,together none of them are really great
44,so let's say that you are in a lab
44,you've been there for a year
44,and the lab is just really toxic okay
44,what are the steps that you
44,should be taking yourself well the first
44,step i think that you need to take
44,is to take an outside perspective so
44,take a step back
44,maybe talk to a colleague that's in the
44,department with you that
44,is familiar with the situation and find
44,out is this something that i'm being
44,sensitive
44,to or is this something that really is
44,an issue that needs to be fixed you know
44,really try to take a step back and look
44,at it from all different perspectives
44,let's say that you do that and you talk
44,to a friend and know like
44,the situation that you're experiencing
44,is not normal and it's
44,toxic and you know it's a bad
44,environment and it's hindering your
44,professional growth okay what is the
44,next step that you should be taking
44,i think the first thing that you should
44,be doing in the most professional thing
44,is to talk to the pi yourself before you
44,try to
44,jump and move to a different lab talk to
44,the pi so
44,during a one-on-one say explain to them
44,come with specifics and say you did this
44,this week
44,and i find it to be you know it hurts me
44,in this way
44,and that you've done these other things
44,be specific don't just say
44,this lab is toxic and you're a bad pi
44,and i want to leave because it isn't
44,constructive
44,it doesn't give them any instruction as
44,to
44,what they're doing that's hurting you or
44,how they can fix it so you need to be
44,very concrete in what you tell them
44,and then see for a couple of weeks how
44,things go
44,does the pi seem receptive when you talk
44,to them or do they kind of just
44,brush it off as you know no there's no
44,problem you're
44,the problem do they make an attempt to
44,change things you know see how it goes
44,the best situation is that if you talk
44,to them and then things begin to fix
44,themselves and then you don't need to
44,leave you're able to just stay within
44,that lab
44,now when i had a toxic pi
44,when i first started um grad school
44,after the first
44,three or four months i had a
44,discussion maybe it was a little bit
44,longer maybe after the first five or six
44,months i had a discussion with the pi
44,and explained that things just weren't
44,working that
44,you know he was being really toxic and i
44,explained kind of what the problems were
44,and again i was very specific in what i
44,told him that
44,you when you do x y and z it really
44,is hindering my ability to grow and he
44,kind of just brushed it off as like well
44,this is your own problem that i'm not
44,really the problem and
44,i kind of knew right then that it wasn't
44,worth staying in the lab anymore
44,and so what i did next is what you
44,should do if things persist
44,which is go to the department head
44,they're kind of the mediators and
44,they'll talk to the pi they'll talk to
44,you they'll see if there could be
44,something worked out
44,and if nothing could be worked out then
44,you're going to kind of have two options
44,either to leave i mean i guess you could
44,stay in the lab
44,or you can move to another lab that if
44,they have funding and that's kind of
44,what happened to me
44,now i lucked out i still had to have
44,encounters with this
44,pi but they didn't take it out on me so
44,when they were
44,teaching they didn't sync my grades you
44,know when they were scoring me
44,academically
44,they weren't rude or unprofessional you
44,know obviously there was a little
44,friction but it wasn't anything that
44,damaged myself within the department
44,now not every pi is going to be like
44,that some of them may get rubbed the
44,wrong way that you leave
44,but i think most of them know that when
44,something just doesn't work out it just
44,doesn't work out that happens sometimes
44,you have very close
44,intimate relationships with your pis and
44,if your
44,personalities don't you know mesh it's
44,not gonna work
44,okay now if you're in a postdoc
44,and you have a toxic pi it's a little
44,bit different of a scenario because
44,you're in a position
44,where you have more power you already
44,have your degree you're not really
44,tethered to where you're doing your
44,postdoc so you could get up and move to
44,the other end of the country if you
44,wanted to
44,if you're in a bigger city with you know
44,a medical school and an undergrad campus
44,there's probably a lot of different
44,departments a lot of different pis and
44,you can
44,you know go ahead and move to a
44,different lap now i still suggest
44,you take the advice from you know the
44,grad school portion of this
44,and you talk to your pi first let them
44,know
44,like hey things aren't working and
44,explain why and then if things cannot
44,resolve
44,go ahead and move and and
44,it's really all you can do in that point
44,now in terms of
44,what to do if things are going okay but
44,you feel like you've
44,found greener pasture somewhere else and
44,that you think that it
44,professionally will be better for you to
44,move this is a
44,really tough one that depends on the
44,situation
44,what i think that you need to do is
44,weigh the pros and cons
44,i think the biggest con of moving is
44,that you've wasted your
44,your own time to be to be honest because
44,let's say that you've been in a lab for
44,a year or a little bit over a year
44,and then you decide to move well if you
44,want to become a pi
44,that one year time is worthless you're
44,not going to publish anything from that
44,year
44,you're not getting any funding you
44,haven't done anything to advance
44,yourself within that year
44,so you've kind of wasted it there and
44,even if you want to go into industry
44,there's really no point to move you know
44,the biggest thing you need to do is try
44,to publish something quick
44,and get out and and move into industry
44,and bouncing around postdocs isn't going
44,to help you to get there
44,either so in most scenarios leaving and
44,going to another lab
44,you you waste that time now the
44,advantage is if you
44,really are moving into a scenario where
44,you're going to get
44,a lot better of an opportunity so if you
44,spent a year in a
44,lab with a relatively new pi and things
44,aren't working the
44,model system that they use isn't really
44,up to snuff but you have an opportunity
44,to move into
44,some really big name lab and work on
44,some really cutting-edge stuff
44,then yeah it may be okay to miss out on
44,that
44,year's work and to start over again this
44,is again going to be up to each one of
44,you as an individual and what's going to
44,work best for you
44,now the second part of this question was
44,a really interesting one
44,and it was does it reflect poorly if i
44,move from lab to lab or something to
44,that effect like
44,will it be perceived bad the answer i
44,think is no actually so the reason
44,being is that for various reasons people
44,move labs all the time so for example
44,my uh wife was doing a post-doc
44,for a little bit of time and then we
44,ended up moving because i needed to find
44,another job
44,that happens all the time i know a ton
44,of people that have moved because their
44,spouse got another job
44,somewhere else and they had to stop um
44,there's there's there's other reasons
44,why and they're
44,not always related to the pi but even if
44,they are related to the pi you don't
44,have to come out and
44,say well this pi i was working for was
44,bad
44,all you have to explain is that i was
44,working in this
44,in this institute and you know this
44,other opportunity came up and i
44,weighed the pros and cons and you know
44,this seemed to be the better option for
44,me
44,but then you can follow up and say that
44,you know reasons why that wouldn't be
44,the case wherever it is that you're
44,applying and
44,to be honest they probably wouldn't even
44,ask um
44,i haven't you know seen other people ask
44,in interviews like why did you
44,only do a post doc here for one year and
44,leave i don't think that it's going to
44,be on most people's mind
44,what you don't want to do is get in the
44,habit of jumping from one place to
44,another if you're someone that's
44,constantly every two years going to a
44,new place whether
44,you're in academia or industry or what
44,have you that
44,looks terrible that shows that you
44,cannot stay in one place and give any
44,level of dedication and people are going
44,to stay clear of you
44,that's for sure but one time going
44,somewhere and staying for a year and
44,then moving
44,it's not going to be the end of the
44,world and it happens in industry as well
44,where people go to a place and they're
44,there for six months and then for
44,whatever reason they leave and go
44,somewhere else
44,and if it's a one-off again no one's
44,gonna ask if it's a repetitive thing
44,that's when it really starts to become a
44,problem so as long as you can
44,manage that i think that you'll be okay
44,so i hope this answer helped you know
44,clear things up and if you've been
44,having any of these issues you know let
44,me know in the comments down below i'm
44,interested to see how many of you have
44,dealt with
44,a toxic pi before i know i certainly
44,have
44,um with that i'll catch you guys in the
44,next one
44,bye
45,welcome back everybody so today we're
45,going to do a little bit of a q a
45,i really need to catch up on a lot of
45,the questions that have been asked in
45,the comment section
45,so i'm going to answer a few of them
45,here these are going to be a little bit
45,more
45,rapid fire um if you have other
45,questions
45,make sure to leave them down in the
45,comment below so i can make a video
45,about them or answer them in the
45,comments or maybe if we get
45,a you know a good amount of questions
45,generated we could do another q a video
45,see if people like this kind so with
45,that let's just kind of jump right into
45,it so the first
45,question that was asked that i need to
45,get to is how to handle lab drama
45,and this is a really difficult one
45,without knowing all the specifics but
45,what i will say is that
45,lab drama is never fun and this goes
45,really whether you work in a lab or an
45,office setting or wherever it might be
45,nobody wants to have
45,drama surrounding them when they're at
45,work everybody wants to be able to go to
45,work and feel
45,that they're in a safe space that
45,they're able to just do their job and go
45,home
45,and the biggest concern with your job
45,should be your actual work not
45,what you know joe and jane are talking
45,about in the corner
45,so my advice is that if there are people
45,around that you know that tend to be
45,more gossipy or um have a lot of drama
45,associated with them is to try to avoid
45,them so that should be the first thing
45,is try to avoid the people that cause
45,drama now if you're not able to avoid
45,that person you know
45,maybe it's someone that you work closely
45,with maybe it's the
45,grad student that sits next to you
45,i would try to minimize the interactions
45,that you guys have together
45,and if you do talk to them just try to
45,stay focused
45,don't let them talk about any kind of
45,side drama so if they start trying to
45,gossip with you
45,just tell them you know i really just
45,want to talk about work i really don't
45,want to talk about that other stuff
45,and whatever you do don't share many
45,personal details about
45,yourself the more personal details you
45,share about yourself
45,and your family and your friends
45,relationships the more that you're gonna
45,get entangled
45,into their kind of lab drama so you know
45,try to minimize basically
45,the amount you talk to them and what you
45,talk to them about
45,the next thing is for a five-minute
45,presentation on skills so i take it that
45,this is in general more something that's
45,if you're going for an interview for a
45,postdoc they may ask you to give a five
45,minute
45,10 minute presentation on skills so this
45,is a little bit different than giving a
45,short presentation on your research
45,which would highlight your skills this
45,is more specifically they want to know
45,what skills do you have so the first
45,thing that you're going to want to do is
45,you're going to want to highlight any
45,skills that you think
45,you have that this lab also has you want
45,them to know that you could come in and
45,that when you come into the lab
45,you're going to be able to hit the
45,ground running and they don't have to be
45,exactly the same specific technique
45,but if it's close enough that you could
45,say hey i know you know
45,technique x and it's pretty close to
45,technique y that your lab would use
45,also what you might want to do is
45,mention anything that you know that you
45,think is very different than what their
45,lab does
45,because it may be something that they
45,want to incorporate
45,um so one example of this is we had
45,in my lab a lot of us that knew a lot
45,about physiology
45,when i was doing my postdoc it was a
45,very physiology heavy lab
45,and we actually had a postdoc come in
45,and we're really happy to have him come
45,in because
45,he actually had expertise more um along
45,the side of some of these bigger omic
45,type studies
45,and how mass spec works and that's
45,something that we really wanted to
45,incorporate into our workflow
45,so we're really happy to have him join
45,us so if you could highlight something
45,that you think
45,maybe would be an area that the lab may
45,be excited about or want to get into
45,that could be very beneficial too the
45,next thing is
45,how to handle imposter syndrome so
45,this is something we actually did make a
45,video about it was titled something
45,along the lines of
45,what to do if you feel like an alien in
45,grad school
45,but imposter syndrome can really span
45,across
45,grad school postdoc you know even if you
45,go into industry or you become a pi no
45,matter what stage you are in your career
45,you can have imposter syndrome
45,i know that there's some pi's that are
45,really just
45,stellar rock stars and they seem to have
45,everything but then they go to
45,you know work on a specific panel and
45,they're with people that have won nobel
45,prizes and then they have imposter
45,syndrome because
45,you know they haven't won you know those
45,level of prizes
45,um the key to imposter syndrome is just
45,knowing that you're not the only one
45,that everybody that is in your situation
45,has felt imposter syndrome when you go
45,to grad school
45,all of us go through it at one point
45,wondering whether or not we should
45,really be there
45,when you go to become a post-doc you
45,know when you
45,publish something in whatever point in
45,your career you're at
45,there's a chance that you're going to go
45,through imposter syndrome and some
45,people may just get it once
45,some people may get it multiple times i
45,had it when i first
45,started grad school and i had it
45,certainly really bad when i
45,first started my post doc you know when
45,i first started grad school i thought
45,maybe there was a mistake like there's
45,no
45,way that they should have let me in um
45,you know i'm maybe i'm not smart enough
45,or
45,my lab hands aren't good enough to do a
45,phd
45,and then when i went to my postdoc i
45,certainly thought i'm
45,definitely not smart enough to be at
45,harvard like these guys are just
45,crazy and work around the clock and just
45,can
45,seem to do everything and i didn't feel
45,that i was at that level either
45,um when i moved to industry i didn't
45,quite have it but i know that there are
45,people that have moved into industry and
45,have felt it so
45,i think really the key is to just
45,remember that you're not alone
45,and to take a deep breath and to just
45,let things play out i know that that
45,seems really hard when you feel like you
45,don't fit in
45,but sometimes you just need to let
45,things progress and as they move forward
45,and you're able to move
45,forward in that particular stage of your
45,career
45,things will start to make more sense to
45,you and things will start to improve and
45,you won't really feel like an imposter
45,anymore
45,um the
45,next one is how to give an elevator
45,pitch so this is something that is
45,really important
45,and you really need three components to
45,an elevator pitch
45,so the first thing is you need to be
45,able to introduce yourself quickly
45,hi my name is justin and i run a youtube
45,channel
45,the second thing is to be able to
45,describe what it is
45,that you specifically do my youtube
45,channel is about
45,advice for young scientists that are
45,going through grad school postdoc or the
45,transition
45,into either academia or industry and
45,then the last thing that you need to do
45,is you need to be able to summarize
45,why that is important this is important
45,because there aren't a lot of channels
45,dedicated to this
45,and what i'm giving is real world advice
45,that i found useful that
45,tends to be lost and not really handed
45,from generation to generation of
45,scientists
45,boom three sentences of you know i
45,this is who i am i run this channel this
45,is what it is and this is why it's
45,important
45,and that's what you're going to have to
45,do with your own work is you're going to
45,have to be able to start to summarize it
45,hi my name is justin i study brown fat
45,in this particular
45,mouse model the reason that it's
45,important is because
45,you know the intersection of brown fat
45,and aging hasn't been
45,well established and for this reason
45,it's important you know
45,something like this um really quick easy
45,and you need to practice it and have it
45,ready to go because
45,you don't need to do it when you're you
45,know at work um
45,you know in the lab but when you go to a
45,conference that's
45,really when you're gonna want it down
45,and what i suggest doing is actually
45,getting some folks together that you
45,work with closely that know you
45,and your work and practice with each
45,other
45,get get down to the second
45,of like what it is that you're going to
45,say your 20-second pitch of like who you
45,are what you do and why it's important
45,because when you go to a conference
45,that's what you need to do to be able to
45,get
45,people's attention especially somebody
45,more senior that's really busy
45,okay and the last question that we're
45,going to talk about today and then wrap
45,up with
45,is some you know what are some general
45,questions that
45,i can expect when i'm giving a postdoc
45,presentation
45,or when i'm doing a postdoc interview
45,now of course
45,the largest basket is going to be ones i
45,can't necessarily give
45,because those are going to be specific
45,to the work that you talk about
45,but some other questions that i've seen
45,come up a bunch of times are
45,if you had unlimited money and you can
45,continue on doing your
45,dissertation work where would you take
45,it next
45,um which really what they're doing is
45,trying to prompt you to be creative not
45,just give the one next step
45,that's like easy to do like what is your
45,like big grand
45,vision for how you would move your
45,project forward
45,why this lab so what they're really
45,asking is
45,is you know you obviously have the
45,ability to apply for many different labs
45,and you probably have but why are you
45,specifically interested in this lab
45,what skill set do you have so is there a
45,specific skill set you think that would
45,be important for this lab to get
45,or that you have that would make you
45,successful in this lab
45,and i've seen a lot of people ask about
45,why
45,are you looking to change fields because
45,there's a pretty good chance that you're
45,going to be
45,applying for a position that's not quite
45,what you did in grad school
45,so people might ask why are you looking
45,to change fields
45,um other questions that i've seen
45,are what are your goals for this role so
45,specifically this role you know
45,are you looking to get grants are you
45,looking to learn new techniques
45,and then from there going into career
45,goals so are you coming here just for
45,like two
45,three years to publish something quick
45,and go to industry or do you want to
45,stay for six seven eight years and
45,develop a program that you could take
45,with you and and start
45,your own lab as a pi um also uh
45,how do you feel about moving here just
45,you know simply
45,you know you're probably gonna be moving
45,somewhere else in in the country or
45,maybe even
45,across countries you know why are you
45,comfortable living in this town that
45,you know that you're going to be in and
45,do you understand the department and
45,where
45,where the lab fits within the department
45,these are things that they want to know
45,that you've
45,done a little bit of homework that
45,you've read maybe some of their papers
45,and that you have an understanding of
45,what the lab does
45,um so those are some things so you know
45,leave a comment down below when when you
45,interviewed for a postdoc position
45,what were some of the questions that you
45,got asked that are maybe more general
45,and
45,applicable to more than just yourself
45,more than your own research i'd be
45,interested to hear
45,because this is something that's come up
45,a lot is what are the questions i'm
45,going to get asked when i
45,apply for a postdoc position and so with
45,that i think we'll wrap it up if this
45,has been a good q a
45,you know maybe we could get another q a
45,going so make sure to leave your
45,comments down below
45,and i'll catch you guys in the next one
45,bye
46,welcome back everybody so today's gonna
46,be a really short video what i really
46,want to do is gather some ideas from
46,viewers that have been watching my
46,videos which now we're up to 700
46,subscribers we're doing great we're on a
46,roll if you like the content that i've
46,been putting out make sure to subscribe
46,i could see most of you watching aren't
46,subscribed so let's help you know keep
46,growing the channel
46,but i have noticed that a large amount
46,of people watching these videos are
46,international
46,now i have done one kind of interview
46,with my wife who came you know
46,internationally um
46,for grad school and she did a postdoc
46,here as well
46,and what i really want to do is set up
46,another video
46,where i'm going to ask her
46,you know the questions that you guys
46,have so a lot of you are international
46,so whether it's for grad school or for a
46,postdoc you know i really want to know
46,what it is that you guys want to know
46,the best way for me to ask her questions
46,is for you guys to ask um because i
46,obviously wasn't an international
46,student so whether it's something to do
46,with money
46,family
46,going overseas you know what were you
46,thinking
46,language visas
46,or residency you know whatever it could
46,be you know leave a comment down below
46,and i'm going to try to make a list of
46,as many of them as we can and we'll be
46,able to put together a real nice video
46,and i think this can really be something
46,that could help international students
46,so
46,um whether it's yourself or or somebody
46,else a lot of you probably have the same
46,kinds of questions and it'll be really
46,good to get some answers from somebody
46,that actually did come abroad to study
46,so with that i'll catch you guys in the
46,next one make sure to leave a comment
46,down below so that you know we can add
46,this to the queue of questions and i'll
46,see you guys in the next one bye
47,welcome back everybody so today we have
47,a little bit different of a video
47,instead of talking about traditional
47,things like writing cover letters or
47,asking pis about joining their lab we're
47,going to cover something else we're
47,going to talk about mental health and
47,science now before you just
47,automatically click away and turn away
47,from this video i really encourage you
47,to watch through this one because i
47,think that a lot of you are going to be
47,able to find some similarities between
47,what i talk about and your own
47,experience and if you haven't started
47,grad school yet or a postdoc yet
47,i think these are things that very
47,likely you're going to run into at some
47,point and so it's important to kind of
47,understand this and be able to identify
47,what is happening and that it's normal
47,and kind of some strategies and and how
47,to how to deal with some
47,you know hurdles with mental health as
47,you go through science so you know
47,before we start i'm obviously not a
47,psychologist or a counselor this is just
47,talking from my own personal experience
47,so if you are in a position where you
47,need you know professional help please
47,do seek that out and i'm sure that you
47,know whatever university you're at they
47,probably have really good references on
47,on counselors and things that you can
47,use so you know let's start off just
47,with the basics about mental health and
47,the stigma behind mental health so i
47,think you know this is something i i'll
47,go quickly on i think we all have an
47,understanding of what mental health is
47,it's the idea that you know
47,um just like every other part of your
47,body that can get sick your mind can be
47,sick as well and
47,you know just like you can maybe need
47,medicine because your blood pressure is
47,high maybe you need some sort of
47,medication because of anxiety or because
47,there's a chemical imbalance inside of
47,your brain and that's normal okay these
47,aren't things that we should label as
47,taboo or things that we shouldn't talk
47,about i think these are things that we
47,need to be open about because
47,let's go through a couple examples and i
47,think you're gonna understand why these
47,things are really important for
47,scientists so let's picture for a moment
47,that you're a graduate student and then
47,we'll do a scenario for a postdoc so
47,first scenario is your grad student so
47,think about this you're a new grad
47,student
47,you don't know anybody no faculty you
47,don't really know any of the other
47,graduate students you don't have any
47,friends you're not by any family
47,you just feel like you're completely
47,isolated you're spending long hours in
47,the lab so you really don't have much of
47,a social life or a way to interact and
47,go out with others
47,you see your co-workers your other
47,graduate students progressing and it
47,seems like they're doing okay
47,so you're starting to wonder
47,did they actually make a mistake letting
47,you into graduate school
47,and as you go you realize that as an
47,individual that has basically achieved
47,perfection in most of the things in
47,their life
47,you just feel like an utter failure
47,because your experiments just don't work
47,they just keep failing over and over and
47,over again
47,and it seems that everybody else is
47,doing okay
47,or maybe fast forward and you're dealing
47,with the stress of prelims or qualifying
47,exams or maybe writing your dissertation
47,or you're wondering you know will i ever
47,be able to graduate or you have the
47,constant stress of feeling like maybe my
47,project isn't panning out right and if
47,my project doesn't pan out will i be
47,able to have enough data to write a
47,dissertation and be able to graduate am
47,i even going to be able to find a
47,postdoc
47,all of this on top of the long hours
47,you're in the lab morning day night you
47,don't have the social life you see all
47,of your friends starting families and
47,working jobs and making good money and
47,you're meanwhile broke with you know no
47,sense of what day of the week it is
47,because every day is a work day there is
47,no weekend there is no fun and it's
47,every day every day every day
47,you know tell me if that sounds like
47,something that you've been through
47,yourself or something that you've
47,experienced
47,you know the same thing happens when you
47,go for a postdoc
47,you go and you get this feeling of you
47,know angst that you have to start over
47,again that you're starting from ground
47,zero you finally felt like you mastered
47,some material and some techniques and
47,now you're starting over again and the
47,techniques you're learning again don't
47,work and you're wondering was it a fluke
47,did i do well in my graduate school and
47,that was just a fluke and now if i go
47,somewhere else i can't succeed anymore
47,you know you're wondering whether you're
47,going to be able to get that cell nature
47,science paper you're wondering if you're
47,ever going to get that grant that you
47,need to continue working you're
47,wondering with all of these really
47,successful people around me how am i
47,ever going to find a position as a pi
47,how will i ever be able to get myself
47,into industry
47,you know these are real
47,feelings that i think most of us go
47,through and it's a shame that nobody
47,talks about this you know we we live in
47,this isolated area where we work really
47,long hours
47,everyone is always trying to work more
47,than the next person it's just one big
47,competition and it's not just a
47,competition within your own
47,um company you know it's one thing if
47,you go into business and you're
47,competing against the three other people
47,you know in a company that are in the
47,same level as you you're competing
47,against every scientist in the world
47,everyone wants to be the best scientist
47,you know everyone wants to be the top in
47,their field so you're competing against
47,the best the brightest minds with the
47,best access to technology the ones that
47,are always working the ones that never
47,sleep the ones that sacrifice their
47,family life
47,the ones that
47,you know would give their right right
47,arm to be able to win the next nobel
47,prize that's what you're competing
47,against every single day
47,and it's no wonder that so many of us
47,deal with anxiety
47,we're always anxious right
47,we're always
47,worried about the next step in our
47,career a lot of people deal with
47,depression a lot of people feel sad they
47,feel
47,overworked they feel tired they feel
47,like it's not worth it anymore
47,um
47,you know a lot of us went into graduate
47,school with some kind of a grander
47,vision right a lot of us don't go into
47,graduate school because we want to make
47,a ton of money right a lot of us are
47,smart enough that if we wanted to could
47,have gone to medical school and been a
47,doctor or been a lawyer or done
47,something else that could earn more
47,money we went into research because we
47,wanted to make a difference
47,we wanted to understand how the world
47,around us works we like the puzzle we
47,like the game
47,we like
47,knowing that our research is going to
47,somehow make a difference in somebody
47,else's life
47,we're going to be the first one
47,to discover a new field or a new area of
47,research we love that feeling of getting
47,new data and and trying to come up with
47,a new hypothesis because of it or
47,proving our theory was correct
47,it's a wonderful wonderful feeling and
47,that's why we go into it
47,and then somewhere along the line some
47,of that disappears and we start
47,wondering did we make a mistake did we
47,miscalculate you know were we just so
47,young and and simple-minded that we just
47,thought it was gonna be roses the whole
47,time and instead you know we get pricked
47,with the thorns
47,um
47,this is totally normal
47,and i think by now if you're watching
47,you're probably shaking your head in
47,agreement saying yes yes i i've felt
47,this before i know i have in fact if you
47,have leave a comment down below you know
47,what i'm not afraid to say that i've
47,dealt with some of these exact same
47,feelings in fact basically everything
47,i've talked about i've in one way or
47,another had the same kind of feeling in
47,in grad school and in my post doc
47,now luckily it does get better you know
47,you move on and your career moves
47,forward and and there is light at the
47,end of the tunnel but the question is
47,how do we get to you know that light at
47,the end of the tunnel and keep moving
47,forward especially when everything can
47,seem really bleak and let's face it when
47,you're doing grad school or
47,um
47,you know postdoc it's a war of attrition
47,the ones that finish
47,and and defend their dissertation aren't
47,always the smartest
47,they're the ones that have the most
47,attrition they're the ones that can be
47,knocked down and get back up and get
47,knocked down and get back up and get
47,knocked down and get back up and
47,continually take that you know
47,punishment if you will and just never
47,quit
47,and it takes some some real dedication
47,to do so
47,you know what are my suggestions for
47,trying to deal with this so
47,the first and definitely the most
47,important thing is getting a support
47,system okay so that could be a
47,significant other it could be your
47,parents siblings
47,you know classmates it could be friends
47,you know whoever it is
47,it could be a combination of many of
47,these people have people that you could
47,talk to
47,and try to also have at least one person
47,that you could talk to that has an idea
47,of what you're going through so i'm
47,really really fortunate in that my wife
47,is also a scientist so if i ever have
47,trouble she knows exactly what i'm going
47,through because she's been through the
47,exact same thing now not everybody is
47,that fortunate but if you can have
47,somebody that's involved in science that
47,makes it a lot easier but even if you
47,don't
47,having people that you could talk to and
47,rely on as a support system is the most
47,important thing especially
47,if you're someone that's an
47,international student right so if you're
47,coming to the us for the first time you
47,know you you did your undergrad and now
47,you've come to the us for grad school
47,you're all alone you know if you can
47,know some people from the same country
47,that you came from that could be really
47,helpful i know that there's a lot of
47,schools where you know if you're from
47,china a lot of the chinese
47,community will stick together if you're
47,from iraq a lot of the iraqi population
47,will stick together and that's really
47,good it gives you a sense of community
47,and home and family um
47,but you are going to need that kind of a
47,safety net because you're going to be
47,sort of isolated and on your own but
47,even if you're you know staying within
47,the same country you still need that
47,that safety net you need people that you
47,can rely on to talk to
47,the next thing is that you need to write
47,down your goals
47,i cannot stress this enough if you don't
47,know what your goals are you're going to
47,be
47,aimlessly wandering basically you need
47,to be able to to articulate what your
47,goals are so for example if you're a
47,graduate student
47,break up your goals your first goal is
47,to get to your you know end of your
47,classes the next goal is to do your
47,qualifying exams the next goal is to
47,publish a paper the next goal is to
47,defend your dissertation
47,write out those goals and stick them
47,somewhere that you could always see them
47,never lose sight of those goals
47,you're gonna need to know those goals
47,because on those really
47,really grueling days where you just want
47,to throw in the towel and quit if you
47,don't have those goals in mind you're
47,going to quit
47,you're going to want you're going to
47,walk away and quit
47,you need to know what it is that you're
47,working for when you feel like you've
47,just about had enough you need to be
47,able to look at those goals and say you
47,know what i'm almost at that next goal
47,if i could push just a little bit more
47,i'll be able to get to a point where i
47,could sit for my qualifying exams
47,um
47,that's really important
47,the next thing that you're gonna need
47,is you're gonna need some hobbies um
47,everyone has things they like to do and
47,unfortunately what happens is as we
47,start doing science we work so many
47,hours you're working
47,40 50 60 70 80 hours a week you're
47,working non-stop and you're tired and
47,when you're done all you want to do is
47,go home and sit on the couch
47,eat popcorn and watch netflix and i get
47,it i've been there but you also need
47,other things that you want to do maybe
47,that's exercising maybe that's um doing
47,some knitting maybe that's reading books
47,maybe that's going on nature walks um
47,whatever your hobby could be you need
47,something you need a way
47,to unwind okay so for me
47,i had some video games that i enjoyed
47,playing with friends
47,also later after my wife and i got
47,married we got a dog and i enjoyed
47,training my dog and taking him for walks
47,and playing with him and those kinds of
47,things became hobbies you know the other
47,thing is obviously spending a lot of
47,time with my wife you know if you have a
47,family
47,make sure that you spend time with them
47,and that sort of is going to lead into
47,my next point that i'll get to in a
47,second but for hobbies you need to make
47,sure that you have something that's
47,going to keep you grounded in reality
47,it's really easy to let research become
47,the sole focus of our life and it's
47,really easy to let our research define
47,who we are and that's actually something
47,that i struggled a lot with was that um
47,my identity was tied to my science the
47,problem with that is you are more than
47,that
47,you should be more than that and if
47,anything goes wrong in your science
47,if you've tied your identity to that
47,science then if something goes wrong
47,then you will believe inherently that
47,there's something wrong with you and
47,that's not true the two are different
47,you cannot let your science define who
47,you are as an individual
47,now the next thing is making time for
47,your family particularly if you're
47,married you have kids
47,you need to set aside that time for your
47,family and and if you don't you're gonna
47,go crazy and your family's gonna miss
47,you i think this one's pretty
47,self-explanatory make sure you have time
47,for your family
47,the last thing that i'll say is if you
47,find yourself in a position where you
47,feel like you really just can't handle
47,it anymore
47,maybe you need to talk to your pi
47,maybe you need to talk to a department
47,head
47,you need to find a way to get these
47,feelings out and try to find a better
47,routine that's going to be more
47,acceptable for your own state everyone's
47,different so there are some people that
47,are just they're just machines they
47,could just work 80 hours a week every
47,week and
47,be totally fine and there's others that
47,after 40 they're tapped out and they
47,really just can't give another ounce of
47,it
47,you need to find what works for you and
47,particularly with your pi you need to
47,work out what that is
47,and if you've gotten to a point where
47,you've done that and you still feel like
47,you just mentally can't get over that
47,hurdle i encourage you to seek help talk
47,to a counselor or you know
47,some kind of social worker or therapist
47,or somebody you know take that extra
47,time once a week to talk to somebody um
47,you know
47,it it will help and
47,what i really can't stress enough and
47,i'm sure i've already said it in this
47,video at least once if not
47,multiple times
47,don't forget
47,the same is what we've talked about
47,before with imposter syndrome is that
47,you're not alone okay
47,these feelings of anxiety or depression
47,isolation feeling like you made a
47,mistake
47,these are things that
47,all of us go through every single one of
47,us everyone that's ever succeeded in a
47,phd
47,or in science
47,they've gone through this
47,you you are not alone
47,don't ever lose sight of that that's
47,something that really helped me
47,and whenever i did have troubles i
47,always reminded myself of that that you
47,know
47,i'm not alone that others have gone
47,through this and they've succeeded and
47,if they could do it i could find a way
47,to do it too so always remember that
47,you're not alone and if nothing else you
47,could come back to this community here
47,because here you're not alone we're all
47,here together we'll all help each other
47,okay
47,so with that
47,i'm going to catch you guys in the next
47,one i know that this was a little bit
47,different of a video and i have some
47,other videos like this planned that are
47,not necessarily specific to being a
47,scientist but along the lifestyle of a
47,scientist so if you like this make sure
47,to give it a thumbs up so i know that
47,you like these kinds of videos
47,and i'll catch you guys in the next one
47,bye
48,welcome back everybody so today we have
48,a brief video talking about how to
48,develop a poster to give it a conference
48,now let's just first start off with the
48,software to actually make a poster
48,this is a poster that was actually the
48,first poster that i gave you know
48,several years ago
48,and i'm going to use this as an example
48,because some of my newer ones which i
48,think are actually much better posters
48,have you know sensitive data on it that
48,i don't want to share in a video but
48,also because i could use this as an
48,opportunity to point out areas that
48,i could have done better
48,which is actually quite a bit as you
48,could imagine so with that sit back
48,relax enjoy let's get into this and talk
48,about designing a poster now
48,the software that i use for this poster
48,is powerpoint and to do that you just
48,make a slide that's the same dimensions
48,as what you want your poster to be
48,i think this is a really good way to
48,start and a lot of people use powerpoint
48,to design their posters
48,however i do encourage people as they
48,become a little bit more advanced to try
48,to become more familiar with adobe
48,illustrator that's what i use to make
48,posters later down the road and i think
48,that it's a lot easier once you kind of
48,get the hang of it and you can
48,manipulate it a lot more and make your
48,poster just look a lot more beautiful if
48,you will
48,um
48,so do check out both ways and obviously
48,you're going to want to color it
48,depending on you know how how you want
48,so for this one i made it green just
48,because at the time um the university i
48,was at their colors were green but you
48,could go ahead and make them you know
48,whatever color your university is and
48,put the logos up and use different
48,colored text
48,you know there's a lot of different
48,guides that you could really follow in
48,terms of what makes for a good poster
48,that's for a different video we're not
48,going to quite go into that today today
48,we're going to talk more about content
48,so the first thing in your poster is
48,obviously going to be the title and this
48,title is not very good it's
48,characterizing the facts of blank blank
48,blank blank blank
48,the reason it's not good is that you
48,want your title to be a declarative
48,statement of what it was that you found
48,and anytime you're using the word
48,characterizing that is not declarative
48,that's basically saying that well we
48,found a phenotype and we're just
48,reporting what the phenotype is that's
48,not very exciting science so try to stay
48,away from those words this was a mistake
48,that i made i should have been more
48,declarative in what i found
48,now underneath you have you know the
48,people that participated in the study
48,and where they were actually originally
48,this wasn't even underlined um now i
48,underlined it when i was kind of setting
48,this up just to show you but it should
48,be underlined bolded somewhere to call
48,out who you are
48,you know typically you're going to be
48,the first author if you're the one
48,presenting it but you kind of want to
48,show where you are let everybody know
48,now the way that posters are going to
48,read is going to be from the left
48,down the center down and the right side
48,down that's the way it's going to read
48,logically so that's the way that you
48,need to set up your poster the way your
48,poster is going to be set up is going to
48,be very similar to a paper with a few
48,differences
48,now the first thing you're going to have
48,is your abstract and right away this is
48,not good your abstract should not take
48,up this whole third of the poster this
48,is
48,way way way too big the font should be
48,much smaller and the abstract should go
48,maybe down to about here that should be
48,about it
48,um this takes up way too much room and
48,and it just really isn't necessary it's
48,just a summary of your whole study you
48,have the whole poster to explain your
48,study you don't need your abstract to
48,take up a third of it instead what i
48,usually do in the in or what i have done
48,you know since making this poster is i
48,have a smaller abstract and then
48,underneath i put an introduction and
48,again your introduction cannot be nearly
48,as long as what you would put in a paper
48,but what you got to remember is that
48,your poster is going to be hanging up
48,for you know days or a week
48,depending on how big the conference is
48,there's very little time that you're
48,actually going to be right next to your
48,poster while it's going on
48,um so keep that in mind that an
48,introduction will go a long way to
48,letting the reader of your poster know
48,what's happening without you physically
48,needing to be there to explain it to
48,them
48,so
48,abstract and then introduction and then
48,you'll go into results now what i would
48,recommend doing rather than just going
48,into results especially for a study like
48,this which was just kind of one big
48,study that was put into it it wasn't
48,like multiple parts to a study
48,um this was more just like one animal
48,study
48,uh you should definitely have some sort
48,of an experimental design overview part
48,you know maybe like right here and then
48,you know your figure one would be over
48,here something like this or even have
48,your experimental design take up you
48,know a good chunk of this and then go
48,into your results
48,if you have a very complex study you're
48,talking about maybe you have one thing
48,that's really critical to the beginning
48,part of your study like maybe an rna-seq
48,experiment which kind of
48,you know you use and you identified a
48,hit and the rest of your study is
48,talking about your hit maybe you want to
48,have an experimental design overview to
48,what that rna-seq experiment was like um
48,i think that's a important thing for a
48,poster
48,and then you go into the poster now i'll
48,point out that this first part of the
48,figure isn't labeled very well it's
48,referenced down here but these are
48,actually data points from a previous
48,study and that's okay it's okay to use
48,some data from a previous study you
48,don't want to go overboard because most
48,of your poster should be new data but it
48,is okay to include data from an old
48,study and what i actually did in these
48,um there's a lot in these results
48,sections that could be better so the
48,titles and the figures are okay but i
48,think that each one of these like titles
48,takes up a ton of space
48,really what it should be is these
48,figures should be bigger with a smaller
48,title and there needs to be legends just
48,like you would have for for figures
48,within a paper there should be a legend
48,explaining the n the time point you know
48,i have a method section over here on the
48,side but really this kind of data should
48,be in a legend um so there's a lot that
48,could be improved with this i think
48,changing the size of the titles i think
48,that it could be better off with a
48,legend it could be better off explaining
48,the time points maybe even a sentence
48,explaining you know what the result
48,shows
48,i think that you could do a lot more
48,with that i you know when i first made
48,this i wanted it to be mostly graphical
48,and not so much wordy but i think that
48,sometimes some words could help
48,especially knowing that you're not going
48,to be there for the whole time that the
48,posters up
48,after you get through your results you
48,shouldn't have a method section this
48,shouldn't be there that's not good what
48,you should have is a conclusions
48,as well as a graphical
48,abstract
48,to say
48,a graphical figure showing what your
48,proposed mechanism is and the proposed
48,mechanism of your study
48,is much more whether it's a poster or an
48,oral presentation this is what separates
48,the very junior researchers from the
48,more senior researchers is junior
48,researchers do exactly what i did here
48,they say this is my data and these are
48,my conclusions and that's it maybe
48,they'll put in a you know future
48,direction or two
48,what a more senior researcher realizes
48,is that the data that you've generated
48,are just part of the
48,scientific method and that the
48,scientific method is not linear it is
48,circular you have a hypothesis you
48,design a study to test set hypothesis
48,you generate data that either accepts or
48,rejects the hypothesis and really it's
48,the null hypothesis right not the
48,hypothesis null hypothesis
48,and from there
48,you generate a new hypothesis
48,and then you generate a new study to
48,understand that and the way that you
48,really need to synthesize this down into
48,one thing is the so-called proposed
48,mechanism which basically shows
48,here is the cell or the animal or
48,whatever it is that you're working on
48,and this is what i think my data means
48,if i put it all together within the cell
48,that this is interacting with that
48,and this is how they're doing it and
48,now
48,this is the point in that study that
48,i've identified and because of this
48,here's the next point that i'm going to
48,be studying and being able to synthesize
48,that down into a proposed mechanism
48,really is what's going to separate the
48,junior from the senior researchers and
48,it's going to make you really really
48,really stand out if you could do that
48,okay
48,the last thing is the references again
48,this can maybe be even smaller but it's
48,fine
48,and so that's kind of the overview of
48,the posters now when you give a poster
48,talk there's two different ways one of
48,them is when you're just standing there
48,you know during the open session and
48,people come up that's a lot easier
48,they'll come up and they'll say you know
48,tell me about your poster or this looks
48,interesting can you tell me about it and
48,this is where you go ahead and you kind
48,of give them a brief introduction
48,you could go step by step in the figures
48,and the last questions as you go and
48,then you kind of walk through your
48,graphical you know what it was my
48,proposed mechanism
48,that's easy the hard part is when you
48,have to give an actual poster
48,presentation where you have judges that
48,will come and they'll give you five
48,minutes to talk this is much harder it
48,is completely a myth that it is harder
48,to give long presentations when you're
48,brand new and you don't have any data
48,yes it's hard to talk for an hour
48,but once you get going it's easy to put
48,together a one-hour presentation it is
48,very hard to synthesize everything that
48,you want in a very
48,you know concise manner that's only a
48,few minutes long
48,really that leaves you about a minute
48,for introduction a minute for
48,conclusions and about three minutes for
48,data very fast that's kind of the order
48,that i would break it up is i would give
48,one minute introduction then about two
48,and a half to three minutes for
48,results in about one to one and a half
48,minutes for your conclusions slash
48,proposed mechanism
48,now the last thing that i'm going to say
48,is that you need to have some kind of a
48,notebook by you because people are going
48,to ask questions and a lot of the
48,questions and feedback that you get
48,during poster presentations are really
48,valuable i i'm i can't even begin to
48,explain the amount of times that i got
48,some really really good suggestions on
48,where to take studies that i never even
48,thought of during poster presentations
48,so always make sure that you have
48,you know some
48,pen paper with you or your phone that
48,you could shot some notes down after
48,talking to somebody
48,the other thing that you're going to
48,want is to make sure you have a copy of
48,your cv
48,or business card just because you never
48,know who you're going to meet and
48,network with and who you might want to
48,connect with in the future so make sure
48,you have that as well and you could also
48,take some of your business cards and
48,just pin them up as well on the cork
48,board that way if you're not there and
48,someone walks by and they really like it
48,they could take one of your business
48,cards
48,um so yeah i think that this video is
48,long enough i think this is a good
48,overview and kind of some of the do's
48,and don'ts of generating a poster
48,and if anyone of course has any more
48,questions about this leave them in the
48,comments below i'm happy to answer or if
48,there's something specific about like
48,designing it maybe we can make another
48,video on it
48,and with that i'll catch you all in the
48,next one bye
49,welcome back everybody today we got a
49,pretty short video but i think it's one
49,that i haven't seen talked about much
49,and it's actually a really important
49,concept
49,you know as always if you like this kind
49,of stuff give it a thumbs up it lets me
49,know that you like this so i make more
49,videos like this if you have suggestions
49,or questions leave them down in the
49,comments below i know that i try to
49,answer everything you know either in the
49,comments by
49,commenting or by making a video so you
49,know ask away i always say i really want
49,this channel to be to help you guys out
49,so the more questions you ask the more i
49,can answer and odds are other people
49,have the same question
49,so today i want to talk about the
49,concept of being a good lab citizen
49,this is a term that you'll hear you know
49,every once in a while but it's something
49,that is actually really crucial so what
49,is being a good lab citizen
49,it basically means
49,you conduct yourself in a lab in a
49,professional manner
49,you try to help others
49,and you try to make sure that other
49,people are able to conduct themselves in
49,a meaningful way
49,and the more you act as a good lab
49,citizen the easier your time will be
49,right so there's like a golden rule
49,treat others how you want to be treated
49,sort of like being a good lab citizen so
49,some examples
49,if you ever encounter somebody that
49,needs help in the lab
49,please go out of your way to help them
49,try to troubleshoot their experiments
49,with them try to walk them through what
49,their problem is you'd be surprised that
49,over time as you do this the amount of
49,good karma that you build up that people
49,become more willing to go out of their
49,way to help you it really helps to build
49,relationships
49,do things like if you're going to use
49,somebody's reagents ask first make sure
49,that if you do borrow somebody stuff
49,that you order new and replace it nobody
49,likes being in the middle of an
49,experiment they go to find some sort of
49,common reagent and it's just gone it's
49,empty nobody's ordered more nothing it's
49,just somebody used up the last of it and
49,now it's gone and in the middle of an
49,experiment you have to stop because the
49,the reagents missing this has happened
49,to probably everybody that's watched
49,this video and it is a really really
49,frustrating feeling so please don't be
49,that person if something's running low
49,order it especially if you're going to
49,use the last of it you know and if you
49,do use the last of it let others know
49,hey everyone in the lab i finished the
49,bottle of glycine so there isn't any
49,more glycing however i did put in an
49,order and this is when it's expected to
49,come this way others in the lab know
49,that it's been used and that they can
49,work around it
49,always talk nicely about the peers in
49,the lab never gossip
49,you know one of the fastest ways to
49,destroy culture in a lab is to gossip
49,about each other or make each other feel
49,uncomfortable
49,never try to talk bad about others in
49,your lab always try to talk you know
49,positively about others in the lab
49,and along with that conduct yourself in
49,a professional manner even if you're a
49,graduate student or a postdoc treat it
49,as a workplace okay
49,there's should be absolutely no
49,tolerance for any kind of discrimination
49,whether it's against somebody's race
49,gender sexual orientation
49,you know religious political views
49,nothing okay that's not acceptable in
49,the workplace we all should treat each
49,other as equals and as peers
49,likewise you know be mindful of the
49,people that you're with you know you you
49,shouldn't be making inappropriate
49,comments or jokes that you would tell
49,with your buddies at a bar okay
49,that should be saved for when you're
49,with your buddies at a bar when you're
49,at work things should be professional
49,you could talk about your personal life
49,there's nothing wrong with talking about
49,your kids your spouse your significant
49,other you know the trip you took on the
49,weekend but you shouldn't be
49,talking about things that aren't work
49,related that are inappropriate so be
49,mindful of who your company is
49,and in general just try to treat others
49,in a way that you would want to be
49,treated and i think that if more people
49,did this
49,life within a lab would be a lot better
49,and it's kind of a shame that this is
49,something that isn't talked about quite
49,as much i see a lot of people go about
49,their day and they just treat others in
49,the lab so rudely and what i've noticed
49,is the ones that do that are the ones
49,that have um no help in return when they
49,need help nobody wants to go out of
49,their way to help them
49,the ones that sit there and do
49,everything they can to help every single
49,person in the lab when they have a
49,project and they need help every single
49,person volunteers to help them of course
49,they will because they remember that
49,that was the person that helped them out
49,when they needed it so always keep that
49,in mind
49,so this is a rather short video i don't
49,actually have a whole lot more to
49,discuss
49,but
49,i really wanted to somehow bring this
49,concept in i felt like this is something
49,really important and something worth
49,mentioning
49,so as always if you like this video give
49,it a thumbs up you know make sure to
49,leave your comments down below i'll
49,actually ask you guys have you guys ever
49,met anyone in your lab experience that
49,wasn't a good you know lab citizen if
49,you will that treated others poorly or
49,used of reagents or you know these are
49,just some of the examples that i'm
49,giving but there's obviously more you
49,know let me know in the comments below
49,if you know someone who was not a good
49,lab citizen and kind of what did it do
49,to the the dynamic of the lab because
49,i'm guessing that it made it
49,uncomfortable for others to work there
49,um so yeah with that i'll catch you guys
49,in the next one bye
50,welcome back everybody so today we got
50,another quick video i want to touch base
50,and talk about grants and grant writing
50,and what kind of grants are out there
50,what they all mean and kind of what
50,stage in your career you should be
50,looking for these so as always if you
50,like this kind of video give it a thumbs
50,up so i know that it's something you're
50,interested in and you want to hear more
50,about if you have any questions related
50,to this drop them in the comments or if
50,you have other videos that you want to
50,hear me talk about make sure to drop
50,them down below and i'll try to make a
50,video about them
50,so in terms of grants i'm going to
50,mostly focus on postdoc positions for
50,this video of course there's other
50,grants that are available for principal
50,investigators like your r grants or p
50,grants through the nih there's obviously
50,grad school grants as well so for
50,example if you're a grad student in the
50,united states you could apply for an f31
50,but what i want to do is talk about the
50,grants that you could really be getting
50,you know during your postdoc and again
50,this is gonna mainly be for
50,um or solely gonna be for those that are
50,doing postdocs within the united states
50,now this is important because obviously
50,if you're in europe there's other kinds
50,of grants that are out there i'm not
50,quite as well versed in what all of them
50,are and what all the requirements are so
50,i'm not going to really touch on those
50,today
50,but this is going to help those of you
50,that are doing postdocs in the u.s so
50,there's really three different kinds of
50,grants that you could get
50,the first is a training grant
50,the second is a fellowship and the third
50,is a career development grant
50,now training grants are really designed
50,for new post docs so i had a training
50,grant that i received
50,as soon as i went in so when i was
50,wrapping up my grad school i applied for
50,a training grant and then got one and
50,was able to use that training grant for
50,the first you know couple years of my
50,postdoc and it was a t-32 which is
50,basically a training grant through the
50,nih now the way that these training
50,grants work is that
50,um
50,the
50,uh
50,actual institute that you're at will
50,apply for them so there is a pi on this
50,grant who was a professor where i was
50,and there was a whole t32 program and
50,they had an allotment of grants that
50,they were able to to
50,diversify out to different postdocs
50,and the way that it worked was you would
50,give your cv you would give a cover
50,letter or research plan
50,and it would go to an internal review
50,within the institute and they would
50,decide which postdocs we're going to be
50,able to get
50,you know those training grants for a
50,couple of years and you could have them
50,for two years
50,um and so i was able to get one of those
50,very fortunate
50,fortunately
50,um and you know it does its thing so the
50,the training grants are pretty nice the
50,biggest stipulation is that you had to
50,be either a u.s citizen or a green card
50,holder and that was kind of one of those
50,things that's a little bit tricky inside
50,of some of these nih grants um but if
50,you are a green card holder or u.s
50,citizen it was nice it paid for my
50,salary so my pi didn't need to pay my
50,salary
50,it was able to give me some money for
50,training so i used it to take some
50,extra coursework
50,i used it to buy a computer
50,i used it to buy some software
50,it gives you money for travel and
50,registration for conferences so that was
50,really nice you know you could go to a
50,conference and your pi doesn't have to
50,worry about paying for you
50,um
50,and then it gives a small amount of
50,money that you could use for for lab
50,equipment so for example i had used some
50,of my training grant to buy a dissection
50,microscope that i needed for a project
50,so we bought a dissection microscope
50,with it
50,um after you've been in the lab for a
50,couple years that's kind of when you're
50,eligible for a fellowship and the reason
50,that it takes a couple of years is that
50,for the fellowships you tend to need a
50,good amount of data for your proposal so
50,for a training grant you don't you can
50,kind of just say you know there's this
50,preliminary data that was generated by
50,the lab you know very small amount
50,because of that this is sort of the
50,project that i want to be taking on
50,it doesn't quite work that way with a
50,fellowship so with a fellowship you
50,actually need a significant amount of
50,data a couple years worth of data built
50,up to be able to put together a very
50,strong research proposal with multiple
50,aims not just a one aim kind of a grant
50,and so these are longer usually a
50,research strategy of about
50,you know six page
50,six pages single space you know all the
50,way crammed in and 10.5 or whatever the
50,smallest is that they allow
50,um
50,and you know
50,that's why you need to be there for a
50,couple of years before you could really
50,be applying for these and there's a few
50,different ways that you could do them so
50,you could apply through the nih for
50,what's and known as an f32 now an f32
50,um
50,is
50,again something that's only for green
50,card holders or u.s citizens and there's
50,also something called an f33 which is
50,kind of a brother application to this
50,but for
50,a little bit more seniors so this is for
50,somebody that's been there for you know
50,four or five years and they're postdoc
50,and they're not quite at the stage of
50,being able to get
50,a career development grant so they can
50,apply for an f-33
50,but the f-32 is more in that range of
50,someone that's been a post-doc for a
50,couple of years
50,now there's other
50,institutes that you could go to so for
50,example if you do research in oncology
50,you could go through the national cancer
50,institute i'm sure that there's you know
50,a variety of different
50,sister programs that you could apply
50,for fellowships where i was in diabetes
50,we would go through the american
50,diabetes association
50,the ada that was one place you could go
50,i know that there's other ones like the
50,american heart association i actually
50,got a fellowship through the american
50,heart association
50,to look at lipid signaling and how that
50,can impact cardio metabolic health so
50,that's where my fellowship came from and
50,again these fellowships are very similar
50,to the training grants they're going to
50,pay for your salary they're going to pay
50,for some equipment for some labs
50,lab equipment you know you can buy
50,computers with them they'll pay for
50,conferences they kind of have the same
50,purpose but they obviously have a little
50,bit more prestige than a training grant
50,and the reason for that is that unlike a
50,training grant which is distributed
50,throughout your institute these are ones
50,that you actually have to go out on your
50,own and earn um and when they score
50,these they score them on a variety of
50,things so i want to say when i did my
50,american heart association fellowship
50,and i had also applied for an nih one as
50,well they looked at your proposal
50,they looked at your personal statement
50,your career goals they looked at the
50,institute they looked at the training
50,plan that you put together so you can't
50,just say well i'm going to do this
50,research you have to talk about what's
50,your training plan going to be are you
50,going to be taking courses are you going
50,to be attending conferences you know how
50,are you building yourself to the next
50,step
50,um you know they look at all of this
50,when they come and they decide what it
50,is that they want to fund or not fund
50,and you know of course the most
50,important part is that research proposal
50,now once you start getting more senior
50,you know into your fourth fifth sixth
50,seventh year this is when you could go
50,for career development awards and again
50,you could do this through the nih or
50,through other places like the american
50,diabetes association
50,so i'll talk about the nih because these
50,seems to be the most popular places to
50,do career development but you can do
50,them through other places i've seen
50,people that have gotten them for example
50,through the american diabetes
50,association and then use them to jump
50,start their own lab
50,but in the
50,nih there's really two different career
50,development paths you could take and
50,that's the ko1 and the k99
50,so the ko1
50,tends to be a little bit less
50,competitive the reason for that is
50,there's no r component to it and we'll
50,talk about that when we talk about the
50,k99 there's no r component to it
50,you have more time to generate data
50,meaning that there isn't a hard cap on
50,like you could only be in the lab for x
50,amount of years doing a post doc and
50,then after that you're no longer
50,eligible they don't have that same kind
50,of a cap on the ko1
50,and it's really only for green card
50,holders and u.s citizens so it
50,eliminates
50,you know anyone that's in the country
50,working on a visa which is a lot of
50,scientists quite frankly
50,now the k99 is a little bit different
50,the k99 is a k99 slash r00 and so what
50,that means is it has an r component to
50,it and what that means is that after a
50,couple years of the k-99 you could apply
50,for the r00 component what that does is
50,it gives you a lot more funding for the
50,lab you know hundreds of thousands of
50,dollars for the lab it's a lot of money
50,that you could bring in for the lab you
50,know that it's going to be your lab it's
50,not for your pi's lab it's for your own
50,lab um and so that's why it's a little
50,bit more attractive the only thing is
50,that this is open to everybody so you
50,could be on an h1b for example and you
50,could get one
50,and
50,there's a harder limit so i want to say
50,it's either four or five years after
50,five years once you've been there for
50,five plus years you're no longer allowed
50,to apply so you have to apply
50,earlier in your postdoc so this is
50,really for those
50,folks that have really gotten some solid
50,particular particularly solid data
50,within their first few years and have
50,published one or two or maybe even three
50,papers you know very early within their
50,post doc um if you've published nothing
50,and you have just average data you're
50,not really going to be in contention for
50,that k99
50,now
50,for the k component whether it's k99 or
50,ko1 it's going to be the same
50,what they're looking for is obviously
50,the proposal so they're looking for
50,somebody that has a solid research
50,proposal
50,they're looking for someone that they
50,think has demonstrated proficiency to
50,the point that they're at the point in
50,their career that they're going to be
50,able to leave the lab that they're in
50,and start their own independent career
50,and independent is the key word you need
50,to make it very clear that what you're
50,doing is not in direct competition with
50,your current pi and we've talked about
50,this in other videos you don't want to
50,compete against your pi and the nih
50,doesn't want you to compete against your
50,pi your pi is the expert in that area
50,you're never going to out compete that
50,they don't want to see that they want to
50,see that you're going to be taking
50,something that your pi is not going to
50,be working on
50,and that you're going to be able to
50,start your own lab with that um
50,they want to look at the committee that
50,you put together so you're going to need
50,a committee that's going to help guide
50,you through the early parts of setting
50,up your lab
50,and they want to see somebody that they
50,honestly think is going to be successful
50,um
50,and this is your ticket right so
50,yeah having a cell nature science paper
50,those are nice but in the u.s
50,if you want to get a faculty position
50,your golden ticket you know your way in
50,is you need one of those career
50,development grants you need some sort of
50,funding if you don't have that it's
50,going to be really hard um maybe if you
50,want to go to a smaller school that's
50,not focused on research yeah you know
50,you could publish a couple nice things
50,and you know go over there and teach but
50,if you want to be doing research you
50,need to be bringing in your own money i
50,know that the universities give startup
50,money but it's it's not enough they want
50,you bringing in money and they want you
50,doing it quickly
50,um so if you really want the edge and
50,you know academia is really what you
50,think your calling is you need to be
50,trying to get grains and not just one
50,you know the best
50,post docs and the ones that i've seen
50,that have gotten
50,um the most competitive jobs have had
50,multiple grants they got a training
50,grant a fellowship and a career
50,development right so i had done a
50,training grant a fellowship and then i
50,would have tried to get a training a
50,career development grant if i stayed and
50,wanted to become a pi
50,obviously i made the decision to move
50,into industry but you know if i would
50,have that would have been my path and
50,then you have your papers on top of it
50,and then those are the
50,people that ultimately are going to be
50,able to succeed and find that you know
50,pi position
50,so i've kind of let this video go on
50,long enough and i hope that i kind of
50,addressed a few questions and talked
50,about some of the slight differences i
50,know there's a lot more that i could
50,talk about and we can honestly spend an
50,entire video plus talking about each one
50,of these grants if this is something
50,that you guys are interested in so as
50,always if this is something that you
50,liked please give it a thumbs up down
50,below and i'll catch you in the next one
50,bye
51,welcome back everybody so today we're
51,going to do part two about grants i
51,received a lot of good feedback it
51,seemed a lot of people were interested
51,in this there was a lot of questions and
51,emails and comments and i kind of wanted
51,to touch on some of these questions as i
51,think that they can apply to a lot of
51,different people as always if you like
51,this kind of content hit the thumbs up
51,so we can keep growing the channel we've
51,gotten to 800 subscribers we're getting
51,close to that 1000 subscriber mile mark
51,i really like the community that we're
51,building there's a lot of good back and
51,forth in the comments with each other so
51,always look to see what others are
51,talking about in the comments if you
51,have any other questions you know make
51,sure to leave them down below i tend to
51,answer all of them and try to make
51,videos about a lot of them
51,so with that let's get into this other
51,things that we didn't talk about with
51,grants
51,so a couple common questions revolved
51,around uh grad school and then some bled
51,into post docs but we're going to spend
51,some more time talking about grad school
51,and then at the end we'll get into some
51,some post-doc things so the first one is
51,what are grant applications that are out
51,there for
51,graduate students and this is a very um
51,interesting one to think about so there
51,are grants available for graduate
51,students there's things like an f31
51,which is similar to the f32 for a
51,postdoc but this is through the nih for
51,graduate students this is only for green
51,card holders or u.s citizens
51,there's also training grants again it's
51,the same thing it's going to be
51,usually through the nih and it's going
51,to be for green card holders and for us
51,citizens there are some odd and and type
51,grants that you could apply for through
51,places like the american diabetes
51,association for example
51,but they're not quite as much for
51,graduate students they tend to be more
51,for post-docs and the biggest reason for
51,this is that
51,pis have
51,money carved out for post docs
51,but the
51,actual funding for a grad student is
51,going to partially come from you know
51,your pi but a lot of this is going to
51,also come from the department so there
51,isn't as much pressure to have yourself
51,funded as a graduate student also when a
51,department takes you in they're gonna
51,make sure that you stay so
51,you're gonna be okay in terms of funding
51,if a pi takes you in as a post doc you
51,know they may only have funding for you
51,for one year that doesn't really happen
51,in the department they don't want
51,attrition meaning they don't want
51,students leaving their programs so
51,they're gonna make sure that they can
51,keep you funded and inside the lab that
51,you're working in so
51,that's why i didn't really put a heavy
51,emphasis
51,on
51,exactly what
51,graduate level grants are out there it's
51,more geared towards post docs now a
51,really good question is well if i'm a
51,graduate student what can i do to
51,prepare myself for getting a grant
51,as a great as a postdoc and this is a
51,really good question so especially with
51,training grants those can be achieved
51,even before you start so i got a
51,training grant um a couple months before
51,i started even doing my postdoc and
51,because of
51,that you know you obviously are going to
51,rely on what you've done in graduate
51,school to support
51,you being eligible or worthy of getting
51,these grants so when you're in graduate
51,school we've already talked previously
51,in other videos about publishing this is
51,like the most important thing you could
51,do if you publish that's going to help
51,and it's also going to help as you go
51,forward in your postdoc grant
51,if you could help with your own pi when
51,they write
51,a r01 for example learning how grant
51,structure works what's important not
51,important how the formatting is this is
51,going to give you some ideas so
51,if you do that and you go into you know
51,your postdoc and you apply for a
51,training grant or fellowship and you've
51,already written some grants with your pi
51,you're going to be just one step ahead
51,because you don't need to be taught how
51,to write a grant or what the important
51,components of the grants are
51,um the other thing that you can do is
51,that you can just
51,start thinking about who could be
51,references now this seems like a small
51,thing but it's actually really important
51,when you're going to write a grant
51,you're going to need references whether
51,they're going to be for forming a
51,committee or whether it's a letter of
51,support you know from a collaborator or
51,whether it's just somebody giving you a
51,recommendation like yes this person is
51,you know an outstanding student or
51,postdoc you're going to need all of
51,these different kinds of letters of
51,support recommendation etc so start
51,planning who some of these people could
51,be
51,now when you do start your postdoc and
51,you start getting into like a fellowship
51,like an f32 it's more going to depend on
51,the work that you've done
51,as an early postdoc and in this instance
51,the most important thing that you could
51,do is publish again same as when you're
51,in graduate school the most important
51,thing is publishing early on it's
51,publishing i had a peer of mine who was
51,a really intelligent guy um he had his
51,paper the first paper he had as a
51,postdoc it was published in science
51,translational medicine which is just a
51,top-tier journal he did everything right
51,but he had a lot of trouble finding a
51,grant and one of the reasons was they
51,thought his productivity was low because
51,he had been in a lab for over three
51,years and hadn't published anything as a
51,postdoc
51,so getting early publications even if
51,they're not in a top tier journal could
51,actually be really advantageous and
51,sometimes could actually be harmful if
51,you go that long without publishing a
51,first author paper so just keep that in
51,mind
51,other questions that i received had to
51,do with importance so what's the most
51,important part of like a fellowship for
51,example
51,um so for a fellowship what i would say
51,the most important part well there's two
51,really important parts there's the
51,research proposal that you write and
51,then there's the
51,training section where you basically lay
51,out what your training plan is and these
51,are important and they need to
51,complement each other so i'll give one
51,of mine as an example and then you could
51,think about how this could apply to
51,something like yours so i had a
51,fellowship accepted that had to do with
51,lipid signaling and how that could
51,impact metabolism and specifically
51,cardiometabolic metabolism
51,okay and so i wrote out this whole
51,research proposal on that and that's the
51,most important part but the next most
51,important part is the training plan
51,so it was more than just well i'm going
51,to
51,attend a conference every year it was
51,specifically laid out these are the
51,conferences and the times that i'm gonna
51,go
51,it's that i'm going to take an extra
51,course on
51,radio labeled isotopes and how i could
51,apply that to my own research it's that
51,i'm going to take this extra course to
51,harvard medical school that has to do
51,with analyzing larger data sets because
51,i was going to have some lipidomic data
51,sets it was pulling all the extras
51,together that basically complement the
51,research plan that i had and that's
51,really important what they want to see
51,is that your pi has the expertise to do
51,this that you have collaborators that
51,have expertise to help if you need that
51,you have a strong proposal that you've
51,backed it up with extras like classes
51,and coursework that you know really can
51,help build the knowledge base you need
51,to succeed in this project
51,and that you're at an institution that
51,can you know cover all of this and help
51,with all of this enrichment that you
51,need and that's exactly what i did and
51,how i was able to get funding
51,now when you get a little bit higher and
51,you get into for example
51,um you know your ko ones the most
51,important thing is obviously going to be
51,your research that's going to be the
51,vast majority of what you're graded on
51,and then the next important thing is
51,going to be your pathway to independence
51,basically how are you going to move from
51,one lab where you're underneath someone
51,to your own lab and you're going to be
51,able to take on your own people and your
51,own group that'll be like the next
51,important thing
51,now the last question i got is what
51,happens if i can't get a grant
51,and
51,you know there's two sides to this so on
51,one hand if you're in a lab that isn't
51,necessarily
51,asking for a grant it's okay you'll be
51,able to stay in that lab and produce
51,papers and you'll be okay
51,especially if you're someone that wants
51,to go to industry it's not the most
51,important thing
51,if however you want to be able to
51,get your own
51,independent faculty position you need to
51,be able to get grants now if you don't
51,get a training grant are you gonna be
51,okay sure you could go ahead and get a
51,fellowship and you could get you know
51,your career development award later
51,if you don't get a fellowship will you
51,be okay
51,yeah i do know people that didn't have a
51,training grant or a fellowship and they
51,were able to get a career development
51,award and were able to succeed
51,um it's a little bit harder because you
51,can't demonstrate that you've
51,successfully landed multiple grants but
51,it is doable
51,if you can't get a career development
51,award though that's when you start
51,running into really big trouble if
51,you're going to a teaching institution
51,you'll be okay
51,because you're not really required to
51,bring in much in the way of grant mon
51,grant money
51,but if you want to go to a research
51,institute you have to be able to get a
51,career development award if you do not
51,you're going to have a lot a lot of
51,trouble to actually get a position and
51,it may actually nowadays be impossible
51,to get one without it so just keep that
51,in mind to something is that as you're
51,going you're need you're going to need
51,to be able to get at least that career
51,development award
51,um so with that we're starting to get a
51,little bit long i know that we kind of
51,talked about only a few points but these
51,seem to be the main
51,things that were coming up with grants
51,is how could i start preparing early
51,what are the most important parts of the
51,grant and where i should focus the most
51,effort on and then kind of like what
51,happens if i can't get a grant so i hope
51,that we were able to cover all of these
51,today um as always if you like this give
51,it a thumbs up and i'll catch you in the
51,next one bye
52,welcome back everybody so today i want
52,to get into a topic about independence
52,as a postdoc specifically what does it
52,mean to be independent from your pi and
52,when should this happen and what should
52,it look like and what should it not look
52,like
52,and this is a really important concept
52,um so when you do your postdoc as you
52,first start it's going to be just like
52,grad school where you're researching
52,exactly what your pi wants to be
52,researching
52,and i'm going to use the lab that i did
52,a postdoc in just because i'm familiar
52,with the research and what some people
52,from that lab have gone on to do as
52,independent researchers and i hope that
52,i can illustrate what a good example is
52,and then i hope that i can use that to
52,also illustrate what a bad example would
52,be not that it happened but what one
52,would look like
52,so the lab that i went to the pi studied
52,brown adipose tissue it's a type of fat
52,in the body it's thermogenic it expends
52,energy it's good for metabolism and so
52,the focus of her lab all the projects
52,across all the postdocs is all about
52,brown adipose tissue and they all have
52,you know different areas of interest but
52,they all stem and focus on brown adipose
52,tissue so
52,my background when i went into the lab
52,was on the biology of aging i was in an
52,aging lab
52,so i had projects that were largely
52,about
52,aging and brown fat but i also had some
52,other ones that had to do with signaling
52,and lipid metabolism
52,other people had other interests so
52,there were people that were doing things
52,related to transcription factors there
52,were people that were doing things with
52,lipid transport there were people doing
52,things with you know transplanting brown
52,fat from one animal to another to try to
52,boost metabolism there was all kinds of
52,brown fat specific projects that were
52,going on but the theme overarching
52,concept of her lab was brown adipose
52,tissue
52,so what does it mean in a lab like that
52,to gain independence
52,so i'll use two examples there were two
52,postdocs that i overlapped with that
52,were independent that have now moved on
52,to be their you know pis and start their
52,own labs
52,so one of them he had a focus on lipids
52,so he was very interested in lipids that
52,were secreted from brown fat
52,that could go and have endocrine effects
52,meaning they could go elsewhere in the
52,body and act as a signaling molecule
52,similar to like a hormone and he was
52,really interested in how this this
52,tissue brown fat can secrete different
52,types of
52,lipids that can go and have effects
52,elsewhere in the body
52,now
52,he started working on a project that was
52,involved in this and he published a
52,paper on it and it was a very high
52,profile paper and he continued working
52,on this and what eventually happened was
52,his research started having less and
52,less to do with brown fat as
52,the specific
52,topic or main area of focus of his
52,research he was more interested in this
52,lipid so when it's in the body what
52,could it be metabolized to what are the
52,specific pathways that it acts on and he
52,started branching away from just
52,specifically the brown fat and more
52,focusing on the lipid itself and he
52,really became focused on that and how
52,this lipid and other lipids like it
52,could act in the body and how you could
52,try to manufacture them and make them to
52,have anti-obesity effects
52,that's how you become independent yes he
52,started off with something similar and
52,yes he still does have a tie to brown
52,fat however his new focus is more based
52,off of these lipids and how these class
52,of lipids interact so it's a little bit
52,adjacent
52,another example there is a a woman in in
52,the lab and she had a project that was
52,doing single cell sequencing and she
52,found this
52,group of endothelial cells that could
52,have thermogenic effects similar to
52,um the adipocytes within the brown fat
52,and so her work that she's now taken
52,with her to start her own lab deals more
52,with these different subcellular
52,populations within adipose tissue and so
52,she's not necessarily working with brown
52,fat just because it's brown fat but
52,she's looking
52,deeper at the sub
52,you know at the cellular population how
52,can i pick out these novel different
52,types of cells how can i use different
52,kinds of large data sets to find these
52,different types of cells that have
52,thermogenic activity and how can i
52,repurpose them
52,so that's kind of what she's working on
52,so these are two examples of people that
52,have started in a lab that the
52,overarching focus is on brown fat and
52,they were able to branch out and start
52,researching different areas
52,the reason that this is important is
52,that when you want to be able to
52,identify yourself and start trying to
52,get funding
52,you do not want to be competing with
52,your pi right your pi has already
52,established themselves and have a name
52,for themselves and if you're trying to
52,compete with them you're never going to
52,win they basically have already made
52,their name for some themselves in that
52,area you need to have something
52,different specifically if you want to
52,get something like a k award from the
52,nih you really can't have the same thing
52,they really want to know what is your
52,plan to differentiate yourself how will
52,you be different than what your pi is
52,already doing and if you can't
52,demonstrate that then they will not fund
52,you um now when should this be happening
52,so what i would say is that this is
52,something that should be starting to
52,happen after a few years so your first
52,you know one two maybe even three years
52,you really should be focusing in the
52,same area as your pi but as you start
52,getting into that third year and
52,especially into your fourth fifth sixth
52,year that's when you really should be
52,starting to demonstrate that yes i can
52,carry out my own research and i can be
52,able to take my own research and move it
52,in its own direction and you should be
52,starting to to build the basics the
52,foundation of what your lab will be so
52,if you're a fourth or fifth year postdoc
52,i should be able to look at the research
52,that you're doing and be able to say yes
52,this is what this person's lab is going
52,to look like they're going to be looking
52,to do these things and is that what your
52,lab's going to do for the whole future
52,no of course not things change and you
52,you know things evolve new technologies
52,come out new knowledge comes out so it's
52,impossible to predict everywhere that
52,your lab is gonna go but i should be
52,able to know for the next five six ten
52,years what you're gonna kind of be
52,working on
52,and i hope that this kind of clears this
52,up because this is something that is
52,sort of not always talked about
52,especially for very junior post docs but
52,i think it's really important to have
52,this in the back of your mind that as
52,you're going through this journey of
52,gaining independence one part of
52,independence isn't just being able to
52,write a grant by yourself
52,part of independence is being able to
52,move away from what your pi does and be
52,able to start forming what is the core
52,of you know your own lab and what the
52,research is going to be
52,so i hope this is helpful if you like
52,this kind of video make sure to give it
52,a like it lets me know that you um that
52,you enjoy this kind of content and i'll
52,see you guys in the next one bye
53,welcome back everybody so today we have
53,a really good video we're going to talk
53,about my journey that i've taken as a
53,scientist and how i've gone through
53,undergrad and grad school post-doc
53,professionally and the reason i want to
53,share this story with you is a couple of
53,reasons the first is that i'm on this
53,channel giving advice and i've kind of
53,dropped you know hints before about what
53,i specifically have done in undergrad or
53,grad school you know what my credentials
53,are basically but i think it's important
53,to kind of spell out what my journey was
53,so that you can decide for yourselves
53,you know
53,is the advice that i'm giving applicable
53,to you what do you think i tend to think
53,it is but i just want you guys to have
53,the full context
53,the next thing is that this journey will
53,go through all of undergrad grad school
53,you know all the way through to today
53,and i think that there's something for
53,everybody whether you're an undergrad
53,student looking to first start graduate
53,school or whether you're wrapping up a
53,postdoc there's probably going to be
53,tidbits in there that you're going to be
53,able to you know identify with and say
53,yeah i've seen that i've been there i
53,understand what you're saying
53,um and the last thing is i just think
53,that it'll be interesting i hope that
53,you guys find it interesting um i always
53,really enjoy hearing about other people
53,and their their journeys in life
53,professionally especially in science i
53,think one of my favorite questions is
53,what did you study in grad school
53,because everyone has just
53,vastly different things that they
53,studied and they're all just super
53,uh tremendously exciting and interesting
53,things and i i really like learning
53,about what other people have studied and
53,learned and it really broadens my view
53,of science
53,so with that let's start all the way
53,back to when i was just finishing up
53,high school and i was going into
53,undergrad and i think like a lot of
53,people that were going into undergrad
53,um
53,you don't have a really good
53,understanding of what is out there in
53,the realm of of professional careers
53,right so when i was first starting
53,undergrad i thought that you if you
53,wanted to do science which is what i
53,wanted to do i enjoyed science
53,you had to be like a teacher a doctor a
53,nurse a vet dentist
53,or you had to be a professor or work in
53,in
53,you know industry as a scientist and i
53,didn't even know what most of those
53,really entailed to be quite frank and
53,this leaves out a whole group of things
53,that you could do you know there's you
53,know publishers there's consultants
53,there's a whole lot of different things
53,that you could do besides just that if
53,you're interested in science and i
53,really wasn't aware of that when i was
53,younger and so like most people when i
53,went into undergrad i had it set in my
53,mind that i wanted to be a physician i
53,wanted to be a doctor specifically what
53,i had thought about doing was being a
53,trauma surgeon in the er that's kind of
53,what i thought maybe i would be
53,interested in
53,and so i went to michigan state
53,university and i studied there as a
53,microbiology major
53,and i thought to myself that you know
53,i'll go and and live in this dorm that
53,was for scientists really and most of my
53,friends there were people that wanted to
53,be doctors or nurses and there was a few
53,that wanted to do like dental school but
53,it was mostly people that wanted to be
53,doctors and nurses
53,um and what's interesting is that by the
53,end of the first year most of us that
53,wanted to be doctors no longer wanted to
53,be doctors and i'm wondering if a lot of
53,you have had the same experience let me
53,know in the comments down below is that
53,typical where a lot of people go in
53,thinking they want to be a doctor and
53,then you know after about a year decide
53,not to and it could be for a variety of
53,different things it could be first that
53,maybe your grades your first year just
53,aren't good enough and you recognize
53,right away that you're not going to
53,really have a fighting chance of getting
53,into medical school it could be that
53,your interests change it could be that
53,um you find something else that you want
53,to do it could be that you basically
53,decide hey you know i've shadowed some
53,doctors and this really isn't for me
53,you know there could be a variety of
53,different reasons but after about the
53,first year i decided yeah i really don't
53,want to be a doctor anymore i i really
53,didn't want to have to
53,deal with going to medical school and
53,then fellowship and i didn't want to do
53,all that extra schooling
53,i also
53,didn't really want to deal with patients
53,um
53,that's just not something that i wanted
53,to do in my career
53,and so what i decided was i said to
53,myself you know i really enjoy science
53,i really like the idea of teaching
53,and then you know if i were to go be
53,like a high school teacher i'd be able
53,to also be like a coach like a football
53,coach or a track coach or something
53,basketball
53,so maybe i should go and become a
53,teacher
53,and so i remember um calling my parents
53,and telling them you know i i don't want
53,to be a doctor anymore i think i'm going
53,to be a high school teacher and i think
53,this you know caused a bit of a storm in
53,my house because they're they were
53,thinking why are we spending so much
53,money to send you out of state away to
53,michigan state to go to school if you're
53,not going to be a doctor you just want
53,to be a teacher you could have done that
53,for much cheaper and and you know we had
53,some discussions about it and eventually
53,they said okay you know you can be a
53,teacher if that's really what you want
53,to do and so
53,i started taking education courses
53,um kept doing my microbiology but i
53,started doing education courses and
53,learning about how to teach other people
53,and i felt like it was interesting but
53,in the end of the day i felt like it
53,just um
53,there was something missing it wasn't
53,fulfilling enough it just didn't um
53,feel like it was my calling and that's
53,not to take anything away from people
53,that are teachers um my sister-in-law is
53,a teacher and she loves it and i know a
53,lot of people that are teachers and they
53,really love it it just for me wasn't
53,personally what i wanted to do and it
53,was around the same time when i was
53,taking a micro lab and i became really
53,good friends with a
53,a young man named tyler and he basically
53,said you know i'm working part-time
53,in a lab right now to kind of try to
53,make some extra cash and you know it's
53,been a really good experience do you
53,maybe want to
53,come to the lab and spend some time
53,working with me and i said sure this was
53,the first time that i would be working
53,in a lab doing stuff outside of you know
53,the labs that you take for credit you
53,know for a course right if you take
53,chemistry lab or organic chemistry or
53,biology lab this was the first time i
53,was gonna actually on my own time go in
53,and work in a lab um he was a good
53,friend of mine and he said that it was
53,totally worth it and that it was a good
53,experience and i thought to myself
53,all right let me give it a shot and i
53,went in there and when i went in there i
53,pretty much instantly fell in love with
53,the idea of research i really enjoyed it
53,um more than i thought i was going to
53,and as i got talking with the pi that i
53,was working with and i just began
53,talking with tyler
53,um you know it became clear that what i
53,really should do from the next step in
53,my career is apply for a phd which is
53,what i did so i applied for a bunch of
53,phd programs all around the country i
53,studied for the gre and took the gre
53,and i i settled on one program it was a
53,cell biology microbiology program at
53,southern illinois university and the
53,degree was through southern illinois but
53,we were doing the schooling through the
53,medical school southern illinois
53,university school of medicine
53,and so i joined this department
53,um
53,because it seemed like the best option
53,to be honest and i liked the pi that i
53,was going to be working with
53,he seemed like a good guy he was doing
53,work on cancer and i thought that was
53,cool like to be able to say i was going
53,to be studying cancer and i was excited
53,to do that and so i joined this lab and
53,i almost immediately regretted it i
53,joined the lab
53,and
53,the culture of the lab was very poor it
53,was a very toxic
53,lab environment and a lot of experiments
53,didn't really work very well
53,and i saw other peers that had stepped
53,in that you know seemed to be finding
53,some level of success where i wasn't
53,um i didn't have really any friends at
53,the time
53,and it was a very isolating lonely
53,experience and i really felt like
53,quitting in fact at one point i think i
53,even did talk to some some friends at
53,the university and say you know i think
53,i want to drop out and i talked to my
53,parents and i said i think i want to
53,drop out maybe this was a mistake going
53,to graduate school maybe i'm not really
53,cut out for doing graduate school and i
53,had a core group of friends um that sort
53,of said you know instead of dropping out
53,why don't you
53,talk with the department head and see if
53,you could find another lab that you
53,could transfer to and actually funny
53,story in that group of friends one of
53,them um ended up becoming my wife uh we
53,ended up getting married um
53,and so i i talked to the department head
53,and they all pointed out that there was
53,one pi who was a
53,big name and i didn't realize at the
53,time how bit but a big name pi that that
53,just recently got funding why don't you
53,talk to him it seems people like him and
53,you can maybe go to his lab
53,and so i went and i talked to this this
53,this guy and i said you know look i'm in
53,this lab it just isn't working out but i
53,don't necessarily want to drop out of
53,graduate school you know do you have a
53,position for me in your lap
53,we talked for about two hours actually
53,quite a long time and he asked about my
53,interests and and actually most of what
53,we talked about wasn't even about um
53,science most of the questions that he
53,asked me thinking back to it were about
53,me personally you know like where did i
53,grow up what were my interests growing
53,up he really wanted to know who i was as
53,a person i didn't understand why at the
53,time but looking back it's pretty clear
53,that you know success in science isn't
53,necessarily about your scientific skill
53,i mean obviously there
53,that is a big proponent of it but
53,there's a lot more to it than that and
53,that's really what he was trying to
53,probe when he was talking to me and
53,eventually he said sure come join my lab
53,and this was the best decision that i
53,ever made was joining his lab he became
53,like a father figure to me um
53,i still talked to him this day even
53,though it's been years since i i've been
53,working with him in the lab
53,um became close with his wife uh
53,know about his whole family got to know
53,tons of people it was an eye-opening
53,experience and in this lab i studied a
53,biology of aging it was an aging lab so
53,how can we um
53,prevent aging and age-related disease
53,and i studied in that lab brown adipose
53,tissue it's a thermogenic kind of fat
53,and in that lab i really learned a lot
53,about
53,science and and uh the scientific method
53,and writing for papers and grants and
53,just how to communicate and conduct
53,yourself at conferences like i really
53,grew a lot professionally in that lab
53,and i think a lot of us go through this
53,experience where you go in and then when
53,you leave you're a completely different
53,person so a lot of people mistake the
53,point of a phd the point of a phd isn't
53,to become
53,better educated in science yes that
53,happens is a byproduct but really the
53,point of a phd is to break you down and
53,rebuild you up that's exactly what
53,happens when you do a phd they break you
53,everything fails everything is wrong you
53,you feel like you know nothing they
53,totally break you and then they build
53,you back up from the ground up and they
53,build you with confidence and they build
53,you with the knowledge of how to think
53,critically how to look for the right
53,answers how to
53,um approach the scientific method and
53,answer and address you know a complex
53,question and that's the point of a phd
53,it's to be broken down and rebuilt up
53,and if you walk away with that then you
53,had a successful phd and i did
53,um i published a lot there i learned how
53,to write grants i learned what i know
53,and i learned what i don't know which is
53,even more important to learn what you
53,don't know
53,um
53,and then eventually i remember um
53,you know as i was studying brown fat the
53,lab that i was working in wasn't really
53,focused on brown fat it was a biology of
53,aging lab and so
53,during this time
53,uh i needed help uh to to move my
53,projects forward i needed better
53,literature and i remember that my pi at
53,the time had gone to an endocrine
53,society meeting and he came back and he
53,says you know i
53,i saw this woman give a lecture on brown
53,adipose issue and it seems like she just
53,has a ton of data you know this is her
53,name you should look up some of her
53,papers you can better learn about brown
53,adipose tissue and i did so i looked up
53,her papers and i read a lot of them and
53,i was actually really interested in the
53,work that she had done with this and
53,actually this was the person i ended up
53,doing my postdoc with so
53,as i was finishing up i decided i needed
53,to send out applications to a bunch of
53,postdoc positions and hers was one of
53,them i was interested in learning more
53,about metabolism and so that's what i
53,did i ended up joining her lab and
53,going to the joslin diabetes center
53,harvard medical school
53,and learning more specifically about
53,metabolism and it was at this point
53,where i was still
53,very firmly thinking to myself
53,that i wanted to be an academic and
53,things worked well in that lab i i
53,published i
53,got a training grant a fellowship grant
53,i had multiple other projects i was set
53,up to be able to to maybe do a k award
53,um you know things were going well in
53,that lab um not always though when i
53,first joined i really was hit hard it
53,was
53,you know man maybe harvard is a little
53,bit out of my league um the stuff here
53,is just so advanced and i was not
53,prepared for it
53,um but i eventually caught on you know
53,that's the thing is there needs to be a
53,lot of perseverance eventually i did
53,catch on to the techniques and the pace
53,and the speed and the rigor that you
53,need
53,don't get me wrong it was hard there was
53,a lot of times where i was working seven
53,days a week in the lab
53,missing family and working and grinding
53,it out it took a lot of effort a lot of
53,late nights
53,early mornings weekends
53,you're constantly thinking about your
53,projects it was different but
53,what happened at harvard
53,was not so much the same as what
53,happened during my graduate school here
53,is where i really flexed
53,the deep thinking
53,how to really look at
53,data that somebody's put in front of you
53,and pick it apart piece by piece
53,what is right and what is wrong and how
53,to really go that extra mile this is
53,like the most enlightening period that i
53,had was my years at harvard even more
53,than graduate school this is really
53,where i i took my career
53,more than one level up multiple levels
53,up
53,and during this time i did you know from
53,graduate school through my postdoc think
53,that i really wanted to be an academic
53,and then my wife went to industry and i
53,finally started to see what industry was
53,like and thought for the first time
53,maybe it would be okay to go to industry
53,and i still even though i thought that
53,didn't really want to admit it to myself
53,i still just was stuck in my ways of
53,you know i i really
53,i really want to be an academic and then
53,things started to add up right it's very
53,expensive living in boston and i needed
53,to start thinking about my family
53,especially my my kid and moving
53,somewhere with a better school district
53,so i would need to earn more money
53,um
53,i started thinking about how long do i
53,really want to be a postdoc for do i
53,really want to continue doing this i saw
53,other friends you know making more money
53,and leaving for industry a lot of
53,different things started coming together
53,and then
53,the the icing on the cake if you will
53,was um
53,the pandemic and i think a lot of us
53,took time to really reflect on ourselves
53,during the pandemic and i did as well
53,and i really thought hard about it and
53,eventually came to the conclusion i want
53,to go into industry and when i thought i
53,was going to go into industry at first i
53,thought i'm just going to continue doing
53,what i'm doing and go somewhere and
53,study metabolic disorders and that's
53,what i want to do
53,but then as i started talking to people
53,in industry i realized that it's a very
53,turbulent area
53,there's a lot of turnover there isn't a
53,lot of room for growth for drug
53,development in that area and i felt
53,maybe this isn't the best idea either so
53,then i started looking at areas of
53,industry that um it doesn't matter if
53,whether it's a cancer company or an
53,immunology company or a metabolism
53,company or a vision loss company you
53,know whatever kind of company what are
53,different types of positions that they
53,all need and one of those was
53,bioanalytical sciences being a
53,bioanalytical scientist which basically
53,interfaces between research and clinic
53,you're kind of right in the middle so
53,after the research has been done
53,but not quite at clinical studies yet
53,right in the middle when you're trying
53,to submit regulatory filings to things
53,like the fda
53,um
53,that's something every company needs and
53,so i really thought that was something
53,interesting and i applied for that and
53,i'm happy i did
53,that you know this is something that i
53,never thought i was going to want to do
53,but now i really enjoy it that i'm
53,running studies that you know are used
53,for fda submissions or for phase one you
53,know clinical trials and it's a it's a
53,fast exciting area to be in and i have
53,an entire team that i lead and i i try
53,to my best to mentor them and teach them
53,um
53,and it's it's fascinating and so
53,where i am today as a bioanalytical
53,scientist
53,all the way back to when i first started
53,undergrad
53,you know looking to be a doctor there's
53,no way i would be able to draw that
53,straight line and if you look at it from
53,like a high perspective you know if you
53,were to just look at my cv it looks like
53,it is right undergrad science graduate
53,school postdoc
53,you know industry it looks like a
53,straight line but the thing is none of
53,us go in a straight line there was all
53,kinds of curves and twists right so i
53,started wanting to be a doctor then i
53,wanted to be a teacher then i decided to
53,do research and i started in one lab and
53,changed to a different lab then i went
53,to a postdoc and now i moved completely
53,different to a different field there's
53,all these twists and turns and that's
53,fine you know you never can predict
53,where these things are going to take you
53,and that's okay each one of us has our
53,own journey which is what's really
53,incredible about this and why i always
53,enjoy hearing from other people about
53,their journeys because they're just as
53,interesting oftentimes way more
53,interesting than mine
53,um
53,so i i hope that this provides some
53,context in terms of where my journey has
53,taken me and hopefully there's some
53,things in there that you identify with
53,as well you know i'd be interested to
53,hear what what some of your journeys are
53,so leave them in the comments down below
53,and with that i'll catch you guys in the
53,next one bye
55,welcome back everybody today we got
55,another exciting video we're going to be
55,going over a couple different social
55,networks that i think are really
55,important for researchers to have so
55,without any further ado let's get into
55,it the first one is linkedin
55,now this is one that's going to be good
55,whether you're in academia or an
55,industry and actually i think both are
55,but
55,um one is more focused on publications
55,and one's more focused on networking and
55,showing your accomplishments so the
55,first one linkedin obviously i think
55,everybody's heard of it is one that's
55,more focused on networking and showing
55,your accomplishments that you've done so
55,this is actually my linkedin profile and
55,when you go to someone's profile you can
55,get a lot of information about them
55,their name their position where they're
55,located and their company that they're
55,at
55,um
55,you know you have ways to show
55,recruiters you're open to working i'm
55,not i'm very happy in my position um if
55,you were looking for clients you could
55,advertise that as well
55,they give you scores on how much info
55,you've put in is there enough in there
55,for people to really get an idea of who
55,you are you could see
55,who's seen your profile posts
55,that you've that you've made how many
55,searches
55,um you know their education and their
55,experience and their skills and interest
55,there's a whole lot of things that you
55,could get on here if you look at
55,somebody's profile
55,but really what you what you need to
55,ultimately do is build your network so
55,this is you know you could click in here
55,and view your network so
55,how many connections i have the groups
55,i'm in pages i follow
55,there's all kinds of ways to build your
55,network and then as you build your
55,network you know you kind of have a home
55,feed here where you could see
55,for example if somebody works at thermo
55,and they're selling things maybe they
55,post an advertisement
55,or maybe your friends are connected with
55,a recruiter let's see if i have any
55,that'll show up
55,um yeah here here's someone that's at
55,talent acquisition
55,in edev at bms and they're hiring a
55,director of clinical farm
55,so job openings could show up as well
55,you know here we'll give it a like
55,um
55,there's people will post things about
55,conferences so there's all kinds of
55,things that can be posted including
55,things like awards motivational things
55,it's a good way to see what your your
55,fellow connections have been up to and
55,for you to showcase things so if you win
55,an award or if you have a new
55,publication it's a good way to get out
55,there and advertise it i think this is
55,one of the big things that people need
55,to do a better job in in the sciences is
55,advertising what we've accomplished okay
55,the other really big thing that linkedin
55,could help you with is if you're looking
55,for a job so if you go over to the jobs
55,panel you could see recent job searches
55,so when i was doing my my postdoc i was
55,searching for a bioanalytical position
55,so these are the bioanalytical searches
55,that i did when i was looking for one
55,which now i have um
55,you know based on what you've searched
55,for and what your degrees are that
55,there's algorithms that try to give you
55,suggestions so these are some
55,suggestions that they're they're putting
55,out there like hey you know maybe you
55,want to apply for these none of these
55,are necessarily very applicable to me i
55,don't really know anything about
55,antibody discovery but
55,you know they try and you could search
55,by things like title or zip code you
55,could save jobs make job alerts so let's
55,say that you know when i was my and my
55,postdoc and i was looking for a
55,bioanalytical position i could actually
55,save a search for bioanalytical within
55,the greater boston area and anytime a
55,job like that would come up i'd be able
55,to go in and look at it you could get
55,salary inside so are you being paid
55,fairly you know compared to others
55,within your position
55,skill assessments interview prep resume
55,builder
55,application settings so there's like a
55,whole lot of things that you could
55,really
55,dive in here if you are looking for a
55,job and i think that in sciences if you
55,are looking for a job linkedin is an
55,excellent excellent excellent way to do
55,that
55,other places um
55,that you can if you're looking or
55,something like mass bio which has a lot
55,of industry positions within
55,um the boston area indeed but i think
55,that really linkedin is probably one of
55,the better places to look
55,um so that's just you know a quick
55,overview of linkedin i think that you
55,could probably make
55,tons of videos an entire series of
55,videos on linkedin going over every
55,little detail of linkedin but i just
55,wanted to bring it to your attention
55,that it's something to use
55,the other one is researchgate now this
55,one is more focused on publications and
55,what you've done in terms of your
55,publications but i think that it's a
55,important one even if you're somebody
55,like myself that is an industry
55,um so for researchgate it'll give you
55,you know your your name and picture
55,it'll give you a score so i would say
55,that if you're somebody that's just
55,starting off in grad school you'll have
55,a score in the single digits
55,as you move through grad school maybe
55,you get into the double digit score of
55,like 10 to you know 15
55,as you go through your post doc you'll
55,get up into the 20s if you've really
55,published a lot you'll start to get over
55,30
55,and you know a lot of assistant
55,professors are in the 30 range and then
55,40s is a more developed
55,um
55,you know more senior
55,investigator and then someone in the 50s
55,is someone that's you know published
55,hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
55,papers and been cited tens of thousands
55,of times
55,um you know so it'll give you your score
55,mines are right around 30 which for the
55,amount i've published sounds about right
55,um you know as someone that's gone
55,through grad school in a postdoc and
55,published a decent amount
55,um
55,you could highlight some of the papers
55,that you want to highlight so these are
55,ones that i selected to highlight
55,um that were more recent papers
55,and i think that this is a really a nice
55,place to find research so what it will
55,do is give you a mix of people that you
55,are connected with so i'm connected with
55,with mike and it's showing me a
55,pre-print that he put on here but it
55,will also show
55,suggestions and it's not just
55,publications but also questions so which
55,way to dissolve tamoxifen is better so
55,someone has a question on how should i
55,dissolve tamoxifen so i've seen people
55,do with ethanol but this new lab uses
55,peanut oil so which way is better
55,so it's a question
55,an answer site and it's also
55,publications and you could see that i
55,have
55,a whole mix of things that are
55,both people i'm connected with and then
55,people
55,that i'm not necessarily connected with
55,that have shown up and it tries to
55,curate this and it gives you a good feel
55,for what is out there and it's a good
55,way to discover both the research that
55,others are doing but also for
55,for you
55,to be able to
55,actually come back
55,and figure out
55,how do i stack up against others you
55,know you could obviously do something
55,like google google scholar but this is a
55,way for you to kind of get a
55,visualization of okay for somebody at my
55,level am i publishing enough and it it's
55,a pretty nice tool and it also is a good
55,way to show off your stuff so if you
55,want to
55,you know apply for a position as a
55,postdoc you could say hey you know these
55,are my publications and here if you want
55,to check them out like this is my
55,researchgate profile um you know give a
55,link for that so it's a nice thing to
55,have i think
55,so just something to think about
55,um you know with that i think we could
55,we could call it a video it's a little
55,bit shorter of a video but i really
55,wanted to just point out a couple
55,different social networking
55,opportunities that i don't see
55,getting enough attention on some of
55,these videos that are out there on
55,youtube and i just wanted to bring some
55,awareness to these again if you have
55,questions on researchgate or linkedin
55,you can leave them in the comments and i
55,can answer them and i'm sure that
55,they're especially for linkedin but i'm
55,guessing also for researchgate there's
55,probably you know already dedicated
55,videos to each of them out there that
55,will go very in-depth so just something
55,to think about with that i'll catch you
55,all in the next one bye
56,welcome back everybody i hope you're all
56,doing wonderful i know that i'm doing
56,well the channel is growing we're almost
56,at 900 subscribers i know a lot of you
56,watching aren't subscribed so if you
56,find this content useful make sure to
56,hit the subscribe button so you don't
56,miss any of the useful content that
56,we're putting out
56,today i want to get into
56,the post-doc interview process and
56,there's a lot of videos that you could
56,find out there about red flags so red
56,flags are things that basically if these
56,things happen you want to avoid them and
56,a lot of these i think are common sense
56,things like
56,the pi takes a year to get back to you
56,um you know maybe not literally but they
56,take a long time or they say that they
56,don't really have funding for more than
56,a year yeah these are red flags and
56,things that that are pretty obvious but
56,what i want to talk about today are
56,green flags things that should make you
56,say this is the lab i want to join and
56,the reason i want to talk about green
56,flags rather than red flags is that a
56,lot of times these are more subtle
56,harder to pick up so it's good to point
56,them out and also i just like the
56,positivity we don't always need to focus
56,on the negative let's focus on the
56,positive
56,let's think about the things that we
56,really want to see out of those pi's
56,that we're applying for
56,so if you're applying for a postdoc
56,position you're wrapping up graduate
56,school these are green flags things that
56,you definitely want to be paying
56,attention to and if you see these you
56,may you know have a winner on your hands
56,so let's start off with a couple basic
56,ones and then we'll start transitioning
56,into ones that could be more impactful
56,so i think one of the first ones is
56,definitely timeliness and respect so
56,a lot of pis are really really busy i
56,mean this isn't a surprise their their
56,calendars are packed they have a ton to
56,do they have a lot of grand deadlines
56,they have
56,you know service that that's ongoing
56,they have their labs they need to run
56,they have study sections there's just a
56,ton going on so you have to bear in mind
56,that sometimes it's going to take time
56,before you hear it back and in fact one
56,of the comments that i consistently get
56,over and over um in the comments section
56,is that i applied for a postdoc position
56,and it's been about a week and i haven't
56,heard back yet like when can i start
56,following up that's like one of the most
56,common questions um i would say that you
56,need to give them at least a week if
56,it's been more than a week you could
56,send a follow-up email i wouldn't do it
56,any sooner though however some pis are
56,really timely you'll send an email and
56,about
56,two to three days later you get a
56,response don't forget sometimes if you
56,inquire about a postdoc position they
56,may eat might need to spend time looking
56,through their funding situation and
56,deciding whether or not they really can
56,take on another postdoc there's other
56,things that could be going on not
56,necessarily that they're trying to delay
56,getting back to you but it might take
56,time however a pi that gets back to you
56,quickly and respectfully and is very
56,upfront with you
56,that's a really good
56,signal so what i mean by upfront with
56,you that means not
56,horsing around playing around beating
56,around the bush however you want to say
56,it that they're very clear about
56,yes i have a position that i could fill
56,or no i don't and if they do you know
56,these are the conditions attached like
56,you know you would need to get funding
56,or that you would need to publish or
56,this is what i'm looking for
56,you know this is what our interview
56,process would be that they're very
56,upfront with you about the whole thing
56,there's
56,um nothing being hidden
56,another
56,green flag that you need to think about
56,is
56,the interaction that you have with them
56,upon your initial discussion
56,so i think that when you initially talk
56,to a pi it's going to be natural for
56,them
56,to want to discuss their lap right they
56,need to let you know what they're doing
56,so that you could judge whether it's
56,something that you're truly interested
56,in however
56,the pis that you really want to pay
56,attention to are ones that also focus on
56,yourself and allow you to ask questions
56,so if they don't ask you know tell me
56,about the research that you're doing
56,or what are your research interests
56,or where do you want to go with your
56,career if they're not asking you these
56,kinds of questions in an initial
56,interview you know maybe like on the
56,phone or nowadays on zoom um
56,you know that's not good a green flag is
56,when you get those kinds of questions
56,they don't ask it's not the end of the
56,world but when they're asking these
56,kinds of questions means they're
56,generally um genuinely interested in you
56,and then when you join the lab they're
56,going to be
56,more interested in your personal growth
56,rather than just you churning out a new
56,paper for them
56,one of the more important green flags
56,that i've noticed is the ability
56,to freely speak with their lab members
56,so what do i mean by that
56,when i was interviewing
56,for my postdoc
56,the lab i went to
56,i had interviewed and i had the
56,opportunity to meet a few of the
56,postdocs that were in the lab
56,during the interview process
56,and i actually followed up with
56,the pi afterwards and she says you know
56,look if you have any additional
56,questions
56,this is the contact info for all of the
56,people that you interviewed with
56,feel free to ask them anything
56,this is awesome this is like one of the
56,best green flags you could have this
56,means that you the pi you're
56,interviewing with has nothing to hide so
56,i actually did i followed up with one of
56,them and was able to ask them way more
56,questions about the lab the institute
56,the environment and really learned a lot
56,and he was honest with me about
56,everything that that you know he had
56,learned from the five years that he had
56,been in the lab
56,when pis do that and they don't have
56,anything to hide it means that it's a
56,really good open culture and building
56,upon that another green flag to look out
56,for
56,um
56,the responses that you get from postdocs
56,so if you get the same
56,formulaic well
56,it's a good lab we get along
56,the pi's nice you know the same kinds of
56,things that you would hear over and over
56,again
56,that's good but it's not a green flag a
56,green flag is when you hear things like
56,you know i chose this lab over x lab
56,next to it which maybe had a pi with a
56,little bit more experience but i don't
56,regret it i know that i made the right
56,decision coming to this lap and this is
56,why you know this pi really cares about
56,you they really invest their time
56,whatever it might be
56,that's kind of feedback that makes you
56,say yeah this person's been here they
56,know what they're doing and
56,this is where i should be and i remember
56,when i talked to um
56,one of the more senior postdocs in the
56,lab before i i joined he had made a
56,similar comment that you know
56,you could go join you know lab x down
56,the hall which i actually thought about
56,doing
56,but
56,this is the reason why you would want to
56,join this lab and he lined up all of the
56,rationale of of why
56,this lab is better for a postdoc in
56,today's day day and age and actually he
56,was right about everything that he said
56,after being there a few years he was
56,completely right
56,he also wasn't afraid to hide any of the
56,negatives which is really good too you
56,know no lab no experience you're ever
56,going to have is going to be 100
56,positive right there's always going to
56,be negatives um
56,you know it doesn't matter how much you
56,you you have a great experience there's
56,always going to be a drawback you know
56,even when i was in grad school my my
56,advisor was like there's literally
56,nothing bad i could say about him he's
56,just the most stand-up person he's the
56,most accomplished scientist i've really
56,been around
56,um it was just a flawless experience
56,except i do wish that we had more
56,experience in some of the newer
56,molecular techniques which he was much
56,more old school so i missed out on that
56,and he was a little bit more hands off
56,almost to the point where it was too
56,hands off where they he just didn't give
56,direction which is a grad student is
56,really hard
56,so even in like a perfect environment
56,sometimes there could be drawbacks and
56,this lab was no different and he was
56,very honest about what the drawbacks are
56,that like
56,your one-on-ones with this pi like they
56,could be really intimidating and like
56,yeah they really were
56,um
56,that you know
56,she's not messing around and she's here
56,to work you know he laid out what
56,the negatives were but then
56,contextualized them that like yeah
56,one-on-ones with her could be really
56,really
56,you know
56,you could feel pretty timid in those and
56,she can make you feel like you didn't
56,accomplish much
56,and it kind of
56,didn't always feel great leaving a
56,one-on-one with her but at the end of
56,the day she genuinely made you and
56,just astronomically better scientists it
56,i mean there's just no way
56,to argue it right so when you
56,contextualize everything and explain
56,what the backdrop is
56,you know it's okay if there's some
56,negatives but that kind of honesty is
56,really really important and a really
56,good green flag
56,another good green flag is the rate of
56,turnover
56,so
56,our post tax coming in and they're there
56,for like a year or two years and then
56,they leave or they staying for three
56,four five six years and then leaving you
56,know you don't want them to be there for
56,too long you don't want to see a bunch
56,of you know eight year post docs that
56,have no publications that's also not
56,good but there should be a healthy
56,rotation of post-docs that come and stay
56,for three four five six years and then
56,leave
56,and if you're not seeing that it's not
56,good if you see like a sort of mixture
56,it's fine but if you see this really
56,good rotation of post docs that's what
56,you're looking for
56,and i would say the last green flag is
56,just
56,how quickly do they get back to you
56,you know if they really are are
56,interested in you you know within a week
56,you should be hearing back from them
56,after doing you know your last on-site
56,interview with everybody if it takes
56,longer than that you know it could be
56,that they're busy interviewing other
56,people
56,it may just be that you know they're not
56,that interested in you
56,um so if you interview and you you meet
56,with the pi you meet with the post docs
56,the lab manager
56,and you know three or four days pass and
56,then they get back to you and they say
56,yeah we're really interested in having
56,you you know we can't wait when would
56,you be able to start
56,you know that's a green flag
56,so i think that covers just a few of the
56,things to look out for obviously there's
56,a ton of videos out there on red flags
56,to look for i want to keep it a little
56,bit more upbeat today and talk about
56,some good things so a lot of what we
56,talked about really focuses on
56,clarity
56,and being open and transparent that's
56,one of the best things that you could
56,get in any interview process really but
56,especially when you're interviewing for
56,a postdoc position is you want to be
56,able to get access to those other post
56,docs you want everyone to be honest you
56,want the whole you know interview
56,process to be transparent because it's
56,really frustrating when it's not and
56,when it is it really just it's such a
56,good sign that that it's a healthy
56,environment that the lab functions well
56,and it's worth you know thinking about
56,going there
56,so
56,with that i'm gonna close this one out
56,if you like this content make sure to
56,hit the subscribe button you know like i
56,said we're almost at 900 subscribers i'd
56,love to keep growing the channel and
56,helping you guys out as always if you
56,have other questions leave them in the
56,comments down below these are things
56,that i try to answer in the comments or
56,in videos and i'll catch you in the next
56,one bye
57,welcome back everybody so i want to
57,build off of the video that we did last
57,time which is about how to
57,see green flags when you're applying for
57,a postdoc position if you haven't seen
57,that go check it out
57,but one of the things that we talked
57,about in that video is the ability to
57,talk directly with a postdoc or post
57,docs in that lab without the pi's
57,interference and that kind of
57,transparency means that there's probably
57,a good culture within the lab
57,and somebody in the comments section
57,asked a really good question that i i
57,think we should follow up with um a
57,video which is exactly what kinds of
57,things should you be asking postdocs so
57,you're interviewing for a lab you're
57,interested in that lab and you're going
57,to get the chance to talk with a postdoc
57,and obviously they're going to ask you
57,questions about your research and your
57,interests and and that kind of stuff but
57,you're going to also be able to get the
57,opportunity to ask them questions and so
57,what kinds of things
57,should you be doing
57,or asking of those postdocs so
57,i think that what we could do is run
57,through a few questions that i would ask
57,and then what i'll do is tell you the
57,question and then kind of what kinds of
57,answers i'll be looking for or i would
57,be looking for um based on those
57,questions so i think the first question
57,i would ask is just a general question
57,how do you feel about the lab and do you
57,you know think it was a good decision to
57,come here okay so it's a two-part
57,question how do you feel about the lab
57,and do you think it was a good decision
57,for you to join this lab so the general
57,feel is gonna be somewhere between i
57,hate it and i love it it'll be somewhere
57,in the middle there may be people that
57,really do honestly love being in that
57,lab i know that i was asked the same
57,question and i said when i was a postdoc
57,yeah i love being in this lab um
57,but the other part of the question is
57,actually the more important one and is
57,do you think it was a good decision to
57,come here because you could really enjoy
57,being in the lab but then honestly look
57,back and say you know what i probably
57,would have had six more success
57,somewhere else
57,or you know i kind of don't like it all
57,the time but in the end of the day i
57,think this is going to set me up better
57,than if i went to x y or z lab and so
57,what i'm really looking for is someone
57,that one does it you know at least and
57,somewhat enjoy their time in the lab but
57,then what i'm looking for really is
57,somebody that says you know what
57,this was the best decision that i made
57,coming to this lab and i think that it's
57,really going to be setting me up well
57,for the future you know if you hear
57,somebody say yeah you know it's a
57,fine coming here but i think i would
57,have been just as good off if i was in a
57,different lab maybe that's a red flag
57,that you know
57,this lab isn't really going to give you
57,the best opportunity
57,so that's one question i would ask
57,another question i would ask is how much
57,intellectual freedom do you have in
57,determining your projects and the answer
57,that i'm looking for is something of a
57,mixture i don't think that you want to
57,be in a lab where you have total
57,intellectual freedom and you could just
57,run around doing whatever you want there
57,needs to be some sort of structure to
57,the lab particularly for a more junior
57,postdoc as you become more senior you
57,should be getting more responsibility
57,but you also don't want somebody to
57,answer that um there's no freedom and
57,that you're basically told this is your
57,project and you don't really get any say
57,in what you're doing you want something
57,in the middle you want an answer that's
57,something along the lines of when you
57,start off you're going to be given a
57,project and as you build you're going to
57,get
57,freedom to have input in the decision
57,making and as you progress you're
57,eventually going to be able to start
57,building your own projects that's
57,something that i think is most people
57,would agree is appropriate for a postdoc
57,um so that's something that you really
57,want to hear
57,another thing you want to hear is
57,um
57,or
57,ask is as you become more senior and
57,you're thinking of leaving do you know
57,if the pi is willing to let you take
57,projects with them now this is something
57,you should also directly ask the pi
57,you're interested in but it's
57,interesting to hear what the postdocs
57,have to say as well don't forget when
57,you're a postdoc in the lab you're very
57,much aware of how much your pi is going
57,to be competing with their previous
57,postdocs and what they're letting their
57,postdocs
57,take with them or not take with them and
57,so
57,it's very interesting to hear because
57,sometimes what you'll hear is you'll ask
57,a pi you'll say like you know will you
57,compete with your postdocs or let them
57,take stuff with and they're like oh yeah
57,yeah yeah we do and then you talk to one
57,of the post docs and they'll say well
57,you know they let them take this little
57,miniscule part of a project but the bulk
57,of the work has stayed in the lab and
57,actually you know joe smith in the lab
57,is actually working on it right now so
57,they don't really let you take it with
57,them
57,um so it's interesting to hear that and
57,the answer that you're really looking
57,for is that yeah actually there have
57,been projects that we've proposed and
57,they've actually said no we shouldn't do
57,that because it directly competes with
57,jane
57,doe who's a former postdoc in the lab
57,and i don't want to compete with them
57,something like that is exactly what you
57,want to hear
57,another thing you want to hear is just
57,um what is the turnover rate of postdocs
57,in the lab and again this is something
57,that you can ask the pi is kind of
57,generally how long are people staying in
57,the lab but
57,again same as the last question it's
57,interesting to hear from post docs
57,because you know sometimes there may be
57,a little discrepancy in what the pi says
57,versus the postdoc you want to hear that
57,you know there's there's you know
57,roughly
57,you know x amount of post docs and they
57,stay for at least three years you know
57,that's really good if they're staying
57,for less than three years you know that
57,may not be a problem but it may be a
57,problem if it's a continual thing that
57,it's like a revolving door and you
57,constantly have new postdecks coming in
57,every 12 months you know that could be
57,an issue normally you you want post
57,taxes that are there for at least three
57,years
57,um
57,and then another question that you could
57,be asking is you know generally how do
57,you get along with the pi and how are
57,your one-on-ones and the answer that you
57,want is that we get along pretty well
57,we have our disagreements but we're
57,always able to come to some kind of a
57,conclusion or you want to hear that i
57,really love this pi like i i think that
57,they're the best and i love working for
57,them um that i
57,want to work hard to make them happy
57,that i think they have my best career
57,development in mind which is another
57,question you could ask is is um you know
57,do they support your career development
57,but along the lines of how our
57,one-on-ones with them it's important to
57,know you know it's one thing in a
57,broader picture
57,to get along with your pi it's one thing
57,in a big group setting to get along with
57,your pi it's another when it's the two
57,of you one-on-one
57,nobody else around how do the two of you
57,get along and how do you interact and
57,you can really learn a lot about
57,somebody and
57,how they are when you have a one-on-one
57,interaction with them and sometimes pis
57,are okay and then as soon as you get
57,into that one-on-one situation they just
57,you know they hammer you and it's just
57,not a pleasant experience um so asking
57,about that
57,and i think you know one last one that
57,you could ask is you know
57,would you if you could do it again would
57,you pick this lab again you know this
57,builds off of a question that we talked
57,about earlier is you know do you think
57,it was a good decision to come here but
57,would you pick this again you know now
57,that you've gone through and you know
57,what you know would you pick this lab
57,again or would you pick you know
57,professor x down the hall do you think
57,that's a better opportunity for you and
57,obviously the answer you're looking for
57,is well of course i would pick this lab
57,again like you know i i know what these
57,other labs are doing and they're doing
57,great work but i think this is really
57,where i'm able to succeed
57,and these are just some of the questions
57,i think that you could ask there's
57,obviously
57,a ton more questions and and i could
57,probably go on for an hour giving you
57,suggestions but i i really want to try
57,to keep this shorter and concise and
57,give you you know five or so good
57,questions that i think that you could
57,ask that really are gonna give you a
57,view of you know what
57,what um what life is really like in that
57,lab because it's one thing to hear from
57,the pi but it's another to hear from the
57,postdocs and it's very important to hear
57,from them right because you're gonna be
57,in their shoes so if if the pi paints
57,the lab is a rosy beautiful place and
57,all the postdocs are cold and stiff and
57,you know they're not happy there that's
57,going to be you in another year so you
57,need to be mindful of that and really
57,take the heart what they say
57,so i think we'll wrap it up here you
57,know if you guys have any questions you
57,know leave them in the comments if
57,there's any specific questions you're
57,thinking about asking leave them in the
57,comments and maybe we could discuss you
57,know what would be good or bad answers
57,to hear if you have other ideas of
57,videos that you would like for me to
57,make also leave those down below and
57,i'll catch you all in the next one bye
58,welcome back everybody so today we're
58,going to answer a question that was
58,asked in the comments about how to
58,manage and juggle time supervising an
58,undergrad student now i assume that this
58,is more geared towards an undergrad
58,that's coming in to do some sort of
58,research rather than teaching a class
58,because i don't really know many
58,post-docs that are teaching any classes
58,so let's focus on
58,your post-doc and you have an undergrad
58,student or a medical student
58,or you know somebody like that that's
58,coming into the
58,lab and you have to supervise them and
58,what are some pros and cons of this and
58,what are ways that you can
58,succeed in this and help them to succeed
58,so i'm actually going to draw on a
58,couple personal experiences that i have
58,so throughout graduate school and my
58,post-doc i actually had three different
58,graduate students and medical students
58,that came i had when i was in grad
58,school i had an undergrad student that
58,for his senior thesis needed to come
58,and spend some time in the lab
58,i had
58,another undergraduate student when i was
58,in my postdoc that again for like a
58,senior thesis type project needed to
58,come in
58,and do some work in the lab and then i
58,also had a medical student that for an
58,elective needed to do some research in a
58,lab as part of his medical school before
58,doing step one
58,so
58,what can you expect and how can you
58,succeed well the first thing is setting
58,expectations
58,you need to remember that when you're a
58,graduate student you're in the lab every
58,day and sometimes when i say every day i
58,mean seven days a week when you're a
58,postdoc it's the same thing you're in
58,there all the time you're living in
58,breathing research your project is
58,something that you're thinking about all
58,the time
58,when you have an undergrad student
58,especially but even if it's somebody
58,like a medical student they're only
58,going to come a couple of days a week
58,and they're not living and breathing
58,your research right they have their own
58,classes that they're doing
58,you know some of them if they're in
58,medical school they're worried about you
58,know step one that they're preparing for
58,if they're in undergrad maybe they're
58,thinking about going to graduate school
58,you know they have other things going on
58,and they're only going to come maybe two
58,to three days a week for a few hours
58,each day
58,so you need to set expectations that
58,they're not gonna come anywhere close to
58,the depth of knowledge that you have
58,the second thing is that you need to
58,think about what kind of project are
58,they going to work on now depending on
58,your level and your aptitude
58,the
58,pi that you're working for may tell you
58,this is what they should work on but
58,they may not they may ask you to come up
58,with a project themselves or have you
58,come up with a project yourselves so
58,when i was in graduate school for
58,example
58,um it was more asked of me hey have him
58,come and just help you with the
58,experiments that you're doing
58,um you know you don't need to come up
58,with a separate side project just let
58,him come and help do the experiments
58,that you're doing so at the time there
58,was a lot of western blotting that i
58,needed to do for an experiment
58,so he came and every day that he came i
58,would just give him you know new
58,reagents that he needed to use and let
58,him do his western blotting and that was
58,like basically what he learned as an
58,undergrad student was how to do a
58,western blot
58,when i was in graduate when i was in my
58,postdoc i had an undergrad student come
58,and you know i was kind of told you know
58,this is kind of what an appropriate
58,project should be for them and let her
58,do
58,her own little side project
58,and when i had a medical student come
58,the pi um when i was doing my post doc
58,told me that i could come up with any
58,kind of project i wanted for him and so
58,what i did was i
58,started thinking about my own work that
58,i needed to accomplish and then thought
58,are there any additional questions that
58,would be really nice to have but isn't
58,something that needs to be done
58,immediately if it's something that needs
58,to be done immediately
58,these are things that you should take on
58,yourself
58,but if there's something that you know
58,you can do
58,with them that isn't immediate that
58,doesn't require a ton of time that was
58,something that i thought was the way to
58,go so for example
58,i thought cell culture was really good
58,now depending on how often they come
58,cell culture may not be ideal because
58,you know you need to be in there every
58,few days to do cell culture
58,however for this experiment they needed
58,to be in about three days a week which
58,he was and they needed to be able to do
58,some basic cell culture
58,and then take those cells and harvest
58,them and try to answer a couple of
58,questions by qpcr and western blotting
58,and this was its own little side project
58,and so i was able to teach him
58,how to do basic cell culture
58,and then how to harvest cells and then
58,perform a qpcr in a western blot and
58,design the proper controls
58,that are needed for the experiment and
58,how to use that information to drive
58,forward a bigger question that we could
58,take in vivo and that was what he worked
58,on for about five months and it was
58,about three days a week that he would
58,come in and if he wasn't able to come in
58,for you know one day here or there or if
58,there was something that needed to be
58,done in between i would just fill in and
58,do that part of the experiment for him
58,but he pretty much ran you know these
58,kind of cell experiments for a few
58,months
58,now
58,the
58,difficult part is being able to teach
58,them what do they need to know so don't
58,forget like i said you need to set
58,expectations they're never going to know
58,the same depth that you do so you need
58,to teach them the things that are
58,applicable to them so for him what i
58,explained is you know this is the
58,broader context of what we're trying to
58,answer okay this is like my big project
58,i gave him the background of that and
58,then i explained this is how this
58,particular project will help inform this
58,broader you know context okay so cell
58,experiment x is going to help with my
58,bigger project because of this this is
58,what we're trying to answer okay and
58,then go over experimental design this is
58,important is going over experimental
58,design setting up the proper controls
58,making sure that what you're doing is
58,actually going to answer your hypothesis
58,and then how your data whether you
58,accept or reject your hypothesis will
58,drive your next experiment
58,you know scientific method
58,so as i went through that
58,you could see the gears start moving
58,within his head so what he learned when
58,he was there was a few things the first
58,thing that he learned was
58,what is the scientific method you know
58,more than just hearing it but like how
58,does it actually play out
58,how does
58,he learn a couple of new techniques
58,how does he learn
58,to incorporate that data into a broader
58,project
58,and most importantly just learning you
58,know from the standpoint of somebody in
58,the lab how much time and effort goes
58,into things it's really hard to gauge
58,how hard or how long it takes to move a
58,project forward until you've actually
58,done it you know so he went for a few
58,days and spent months working and
58,answered you know one simple question so
58,now he has a broader understanding of
58,wow if it takes this much effort to
58,answer this question
58,then
58,you know
58,how long must it take to answer an
58,entire project worth of questions you
58,know like a larger scope of a question
58,right it could take years or decades
58,even depending on what you're asking
58,now going back to the original question
58,that was asked in the comments section
58,was how to actually manage time doing
58,this and this is a really
58,difficult thing to answer because it
58,really is going to depend on each
58,individual and the situation that they
58,have
58,what i would say to do to start is to
58,give some reading so by now you're
58,familiar with the different review
58,articles and original papers that are
58,important to the work that you're going
58,to be giving
58,so give them a review article to start
58,and just let them read through it and
58,then talk to them about what actually is
58,in there again knowing they need a
58,surface level understanding but
58,sometimes just one or two review
58,articles is enough to really immerse
58,them
58,in the kind of research that they're
58,going to be doing
58,after that what i suggest is if you have
58,some common techniques that you're going
58,to be using so for example if you're
58,going to be doing cell culture and qpcr
58,do qpcr and cell culture and let them
58,follow you if other people in the lab
58,are doing it let them go follow them
58,start training them that this is how you
58,do cell culture this is how you split
58,cells this is how you count cells you
58,know this is how you do your pcr like
58,start training them over and over and
58,over in that aspect so the first like
58,couple weeks just need to be training
58,over and over and over and how you do
58,something and you need to be able to
58,take time to sit and supervise them so
58,that means that you're going to have to
58,shift your schedule around when i had
58,people in the lab and i was watching
58,them you know what would happen is i'd
58,end up having to spend more time in the
58,lab than normal
58,that's because during the day when i
58,would normally do my cell culture
58,experiments i had to be watching him do
58,his now at the beginning what you could
58,do is you could try timing them so that
58,they go together so if i have to do cell
58,culture and he has to do cell culture
58,let's do them together and we could do
58,it side by side
58,but sometimes it doesn't line up that
58,way so he may have to do cell culture
58,and then he may need to be doing a pcr
58,experiment you know let's say he needed
58,to do pcr this is like a whole day thing
58,like extracting the rna
58,you know cleaning it up doing the rt
58,step doing the pcr you know if i had
58,animal experiments that needed to be
58,done
58,i had to like shift those around to do
58,it during times where he was incubating
58,where i could go run and do them and i
58,didn't need to be watching him you know
58,so sometimes it wasn't one to one and i
58,could do that with him sometimes you
58,have to split it up
58,the best advice that i could give is to
58,not take on too much at once so only
58,take on one student at a time you don't
58,need to be taking on more than one
58,there's no need for that
58,the reason that you want to be taking on
58,these students in the first place is one
58,to pay it back so somebody had to teach
58,you so now it's your turn to teach
58,somebody else but also to start
58,developing those skills of teaching
58,others okay this is something that they
58,don't teach you in graduate school or in
58,your postdoc they don't teach you how
58,you need to start training others and
58,this is an important skill whether
58,you're going into industry academia into
58,government work somewhere you're going
58,to need to be able to teach others
58,so it's really important to start
58,getting that skill down
58,i highly highly recommend taking on on
58,somebody um
58,you know but just remember that it is a
58,time sink you're gonna have to devote
58,time to this you know when it comes to
58,the end they're going to have to prepare
58,a powerpoint maybe to give a
58,presentation or they're going to have to
58,write a paper
58,so you're going to have to sit there and
58,take time to go over that with them
58,right how do you fix your powerpoint how
58,do you do the conclusions for your data
58,how do you write up a report
58,um you're going to be asked to maybe
58,grade them and so you're going to have
58,to take time to do grading it's going to
58,take time
58,so don't take on more than one person
58,that said though it shouldn't be taking
58,up more than 10 of your time in all
58,honesty um at first when they're getting
58,up and running off the ground yes you're
58,gonna have to invest a little bit more
58,time and it may
58,slow down a little bit of the work that
58,you're doing and that's okay
58,but quickly they should be able to start
58,getting off the ground and you should be
58,able to start getting back to the way
58,that you were working before
58,um i hope that this helps and i hope
58,that this gives a little bit of insight
58,into the ways that we can help others in
58,terms of mentoring as we're post-docs
58,and i think that this is a really
58,important step like i said
58,it really does make a difference
58,and this way you can always put onto
58,your cv or in a cover letter somewhere
58,that you have experience mentoring
58,someone that you have actually taught
58,somebody how to do experiments and how
58,to interpret data this is really
58,important no matter what job you're
58,going to go into being able to say i
58,have experience mentoring others
58,okay so with that i'll you know catch
58,you guys in the next one i hope everyone
58,has a great day bye
59,welcome back everybody so today we're
59,going to get into a video that was
59,requested by a viewer that's interested
59,in moving to industry
59,the video that they requested is to go
59,over what are some of the challenges
59,that somebody coming from academia is
59,going to face as they enter industry
59,we've kind of talked a little bit about
59,this before in the past but in this
59,video we're going to dive more into the
59,first you know half a year or so of
59,being in industry and what it's really
59,like
59,um so if you have any kinds of comments
59,below about things that you want to know
59,about jumping into industry leave them
59,down below if you have any other
59,questions make sure to leave them down
59,below i try to make videos about certain
59,videos i think might apply to a broader
59,audience or i even will answer down in
59,the comments section
59,so let's get into it today
59,so when you're going to be moving from
59,academia over to industry i'm going to
59,mainly focus on phds
59,for people that are coming from
59,a
59,master's level it's not going to be all
59,that different it's going to be a lot of
59,the same hands-on work in the lab but
59,for phds it's going to be quite
59,different so
59,when you first start an industry
59,you're going to
59,have some differences depending on the
59,type of work and industry you do so
59,there's obviously large companies and
59,small companies you know a bigger
59,company like pfizer versus a startup and
59,then there's everything in between
59,but within these companies there's
59,different roles
59,so there are people that are going to be
59,doing research that are in really early
59,base discovery research
59,and and this is really similar to what
59,you do in a postdoc okay this is going
59,to be going in reading papers you know
59,so say that you're a cns company so you
59,go in and you're reading papers about
59,cns targets and you're doing you know
59,collection of cns tissues and staining
59,that goes along with it maybe
59,electrophysiology if that's what's
59,needed maybe you're doing
59,um in vivo work with memory you know
59,you're going to be doing a lot of this
59,investigational type work
59,and that's probably going to feel very
59,similar
59,to what you did in you know grad school
59,in a postdoc however you could be like
59,me and end up in a position that's more
59,on the late pre-clinical site so just
59,before clinical testing
59,and this is a much more regulated
59,environment and so your work isn't as
59,exploratory based it's more dealing with
59,regulated studies that are going to be
59,submitted to things like the fda or the
59,ema
59,and when you do that it's quite
59,different because you don't have the
59,flexibility to structure your studies
59,any which way you want there's a very
59,structured way that you need to go about
59,your work and it takes time to learn
59,what is this structure and how do you
59,conform to it and what wiggle room do
59,you have and how can you deal with any
59,kind of authorities that you need to
59,deal with
59,so it's a little bit different
59,the other big difference that you're
59,going to have is
59,the
59,meeting schedules so i think that a lot
59,of scientists are not ready for the
59,amount of meetings that they're going to
59,have to go to so when you're in grad
59,school you have class that you juggle at
59,the beginning but then as you move on
59,you're kind of just in the lab until
59,you're writing your dissertation
59,and as a postdoc obviously you're going
59,to spend 90 plus percent of your time in
59,the lab
59,when you go into industry you're going
59,to have to spend a lot of time in the
59,lab but you're gonna have a lot of
59,meetings and when i say a lot of
59,meetings i'm talking about you might
59,have
59,15 to 20 hours of meetings a week so
59,you're going to be spending you know
59,10 20 30 50 of your time
59,a week in meetings and it's a big thing
59,to get used to like how do you actually
59,structure your day so that your
59,experiments could go
59,and that your meetings don't interrupt
59,your lab work and you know being able to
59,schedule your experiment so that you
59,could juggle lunch and this meeting and
59,that meeting it could be kind of you
59,know tricky at first um so that's
59,definitely something that you're gonna
59,have to get used to just a sheer amount
59,of meetings that you have to go to
59,it's quite a lot
59,the other thing is the corporate
59,structure
59,so basically figuring out like who
59,you report to and who they report to and
59,figuring out who are their peers who are
59,your peers who are people that are not
59,reporting to you but are a lower level
59,than you that might look to you for
59,advice really figuring out that
59,corporate structure of like what is an
59,associate scientist or a principal
59,scientist what do all these positions
59,mean and what are their importance in
59,their role
59,within the company right everyone has an
59,important role in the company you know
59,just because someone has a higher title
59,or a lower title doesn't mean that
59,they're more or less important
59,everyone's job is important that's why
59,it's there
59,um but figuring out who you know
59,where you fit into the organization and
59,where your department fits into the
59,organization and figuring out where
59,everyone you know fits together that's
59,really an important you know step and it
59,takes time and it takes time to get to
59,know everyone and for them to get to
59,know you
59,another thing that could come up that
59,could be very different is if you have
59,to take on your own reports so some of
59,you are going to go into industry and be
59,what's called an independent contributor
59,meaning that you go in and you basically
59,have a supervisor that you report to and
59,that's it you're not really responsible
59,for the actions of anybody else and for
59,example in my company there's a lot of
59,the scientists have no reports
59,some people have one report so you might
59,come out of
59,your post doc and come in and all of a
59,sudden have someone that reports to you
59,you're their boss their manager and so
59,you're responsible for their day-to-day
59,work you're responsible for their career
59,development you're responsible for their
59,promotions for their evaluations for
59,making sure that they do everything on
59,track and you know if they miss and they
59,don't do what they're supposed to do
59,it's not just them that looks bad it's
59,you that looks bad and likewise when
59,they succeed it's not just them that
59,looks good when they succeed you also
59,look good when they succeed
59,um so you you know some people are gonna
59,have to deal with one person some people
59,will be like myself and have multiple
59,people that report to them you know you
59,might have two three four people that
59,report into you and so then you have an
59,entire team and so it's not just one
59,person that you're in charge of you're
59,in charge of an entire group and now
59,just like when you were a postdoc and
59,you would go to a lab meeting you need
59,to have your own lab meetings and you
59,need to
59,oversee a whole group's effort and make
59,sure that everybody's getting the right
59,work for them and that it's structured
59,in a way that makes sense and that
59,everyone thinks is fair
59,you know these kinds of management
59,skills aren't really something that they
59,teach in graduate school or in a postdoc
59,and i really wish that they would
59,because this is really important and
59,pretty much all of us that go through
59,and get a phd
59,whether you go into academia or industry
59,or anywhere odds are at some point
59,you're going to be responsible for
59,somebody and you're going to have to
59,manage somebody and it's really a shame
59,that they don't teach you the most
59,effective way to do that and and how to
59,you know communicate clearly
59,um hopefully though and again things
59,adding in that are different in industry
59,is that if you are a manager that your
59,company gives you resources on how to be
59,a manager and so that's another
59,difference you know when you're in in
59,your postdoc you may go to certain
59,classes that are science-based and
59,that's good but in in a company you know
59,on top of doing scientific training it's
59,really crucial that you
59,build yourself and your network and you
59,go to trainings within the company or
59,external however they do it but i'm sure
59,the company will offer things in one way
59,or another where you learn about
59,networking about um communicating with
59,empathy
59,about connecting with peers about
59,management about how to have effective
59,communications with your own supervisor
59,you know these are really important
59,skill sets and something that really i
59,think
59,more than anything else sets people
59,apart in industry
59,is i see a lot of brilliant people that
59,don't have those soft skills quite
59,ironed out and it seems they're the ones
59,that move the slowest up the corporate
59,ladder in industry and those that
59,really have honed that skill of
59,effectively communicating with others
59,with building relationships with
59,you know just getting to know people not
59,just within your group but within the
59,organization are the ones that seem to
59,move up the fastest
59,um i think that that's a really
59,important skill and i a good observation
59,that i hope that those of you that are
59,watching that go into industry take note
59,of
59,and the last thing that i'll really
59,point out is just the difference in
59,scope of work so when you're in academia
59,mechanism is king right there there is
59,nothing more important than mechanism
59,and if you give a talk and you don't
59,have a mechanism you know and you just
59,have this like observatory discussion of
59,like well we did this experiment and we
59,observed this but we don't quite know
59,the mechanism it loses just a lot of
59,luster
59,and the pis take
59,years and years or decades trying to
59,work out mechanisms and and that's
59,really the driving force and it's really
59,really crucial to moving science forward
59,is
59,understanding the mechanism
59,that's really crucial
59,understanding that is how we've advanced
59,science for centuries right it's not
59,that it's not important
59,but in industry the patient is what's
59,important and the mechanism is not
59,and so things move very quickly and the
59,mechanism is not something that's
59,focused on people want a surface level
59,understanding and they want to know it
59,quickly and move on to the next thing
59,because you don't have years to do
59,something when you need to develop your
59,next drug quickly
59,so that's something to also keep in mind
59,is that the focus is a lot different one
59,is a mechanism focused thing
59,the other in industry is more of a how
59,can we help the patient today type of
59,mindset and so it leads to two different
59,types of science one not better than the
59,other but different nonetheless
59,okay
59,so i think we could wrap it up there
59,there are definitely other differences
59,but just kind of thinking to myself a
59,little bit today in terms of
59,what are the differences these are the
59,ones that stand out to me
59,and you know it's really hard to give a
59,clear-cut answer of
59,how to
59,best survive your first six months in
59,industry because each person's
59,circumstances are going to be different
59,right
59,so if you're an early research and a
59,startup company as an individual
59,contributor meaning no direct reports
59,you're going to have a really different
59,experience when you go into industry
59,than if you go to a super large company
59,with a whole team of reports and you're
59,in late pre-clinical development and
59,it's all regulated work they're very
59,different so it's hard to give a
59,one-size-fits-all answer
59,but i think the thing that i'm gonna
59,suggest is that you really have
59,discussions early and often with whoever
59,your manager is and set clear
59,expectations
59,one of the hardest things when you go
59,into industry is that you have a lack of
59,understanding of what the expectations
59,are of you and if you could really get a
59,good grasp early on of this is what my
59,boss expects me to be doing
59,you're just gonna get rolling that much
59,faster because you'll actually be able
59,to do something that they you know want
59,you to be doing rather than just like
59,shadowing this person and shadowing that
59,person you'll be able to get in on the
59,ground running and do something
59,um so i hope this you know is helpful
59,for people that are thinking about going
59,into industry you know these are just
59,things that i've been thinking you know
59,to myself today of
59,you know how could what are the
59,differences and what should somebody
59,expect in their first you know few
59,months trying to think back to my first
59,few months in industry what did i
59,find very different about industry than
59,being in academia
59,now with that i'll catch you guys in the

61,more and that's talking about the hard
61,truths of doing a phd what i want to do
61,is discuss what i think are you know
61,four areas really that i never really
61,heard anyone talk about before
61,but i realized as i was going through
61,graduate school that these are things
61,that you know really do make a
61,difference um if you've gone through any
61,of these you know
61,comment down below let's get a list
61,going for those junior graduate students
61,that are just starting finding their way
61,and and let's see if we could help them
61,out
61,so the first thing on my list is that
61,your professor is going to determine
61,your success in graduate school now
61,before people start freaking out and
61,saying whoa whoa whoa you know i
61,actually think that i determine my
61,success yes yes of course you're going
61,to be the main driver of your success
61,however i think that what people don't
61,want to acknowledge is that your
61,particular pi is going to help drive
61,your success a heck of a lot more than
61,what you're going to give it credit for
61,so i'll use myself as a personal example
61,when i did my phd i was in a lab with a
61,very big name pi very big in the field
61,and when i was in that lab i was able to
61,publish multiple papers because he had
61,really good working models i was able to
61,get a lot of co-authorships because the
61,paper the group was constantly working
61,on different projects with a lot of
61,collaborators so i was able to do that
61,he was often invited to write review
61,articles it was nice enough to let me
61,co-author or even sometimes sometimes be
61,first author on those review articles
61,i got to know a lot of people and build
61,a really great network
61,give oral presentations
61,you know ultimately everything kind of
61,came together in a package where i was
61,fortunate enough to
61,you know when i applied for a postdoc i
61,applied for one at mit and a couple at
61,harvard and harvard medical school and
61,that was it a very small amount of
61,postdoc applications actually went out
61,and i had you know interest basically
61,from all of them and you know ended up
61,doing my postdoc at harvard medical
61,school
61,now
61,before i was in this lab i actually
61,spent a short amount of time doing work
61,in a different lab and this lab
61,had quite a toxic environment and that's
61,really the reason that i left was that
61,it just wasn't working for me and it
61,wasn't working for the pi it just wasn't
61,a good match
61,i think if i would have stayed in that
61,lab i still would have been able to get
61,my degree and i still would have been
61,able to do a postdoc and i would have
61,been able to find my own success within
61,my career but would i have ended up at
61,harvard i don't honestly believe so and
61,that's just a hard truth of the matter
61,is that
61,you know i'm
61,found success and i would find success
61,in different labs however
61,one of the reasons i found as much
61,success as i did and what's kind of set
61,me up pretty well in my career was the
61,pi that i did graduate school with and
61,that's just one of the truths of doing
61,graduate school is that you know you may
61,be in a lab and notice that your buddy
61,over on the side they're in a different
61,lab and that lab is a big name and they
61,just are going to have more
61,opportunities presented to them and
61,that's just something that isn't really
61,spoken about but really is a truth about
61,you know success coming out of graduate
61,school
61,another thing that i want to talk about
61,is the constant lying that you're going
61,to walk between competitiveness
61,and needing those around you so let me
61,explain
61,as you go through graduate school and
61,and this also will apply for a postdoc
61,as well
61,you are
61,going to be
61,walking this fine line on one hand
61,you're really really going to need those
61,around you especially as a junior
61,graduate student you're going to need to
61,learn about
61,prelim exams or qualifying exams about
61,classes about
61,finishing up your credits about
61,formatting your dissertation about
61,you know
61,uh
61,which professors do i need to put on my
61,committee there's all kinds of things
61,that you're gonna need help with and
61,then that doesn't even get into the fact
61,that when you're starting off in a lab
61,things aren't always gonna work and
61,you're gonna need help just with the the
61,simple techniques in the lab how do you
61,run a western blot how do you do pcr how
61,do you do cell culture you know whatever
61,it might be
61,on the other hand though there's a hyper
61,competitiveness
61,to doing a phd
61,there's always this competitiveness of
61,who's going to spend more time in the
61,lab there's sometimes some pis will pit
61,each other you know graduate students or
61,postdocs against each other to work on
61,the same project and see who could you
61,know finish the project first or do it
61,better so you're gonna need to be able
61,to walk this really delicate line of
61,needing people
61,so you could succeed but also
61,maintaining the distance that you need
61,because of that competitive
61,you know nature that there is and not
61,wanting to be taken advantage of and
61,there's a lot of politics that go into
61,this this is something that they really
61,don't teach you you think that just
61,because you're not in a business setting
61,that some of these you know the politics
61,of the office go away and they really
61,don't um they're they're quite real and
61,they're quite there and you really need
61,to learn how to walk that fine line
61,another thing that i want to talk about
61,is the amount of time that you're going
61,to spend in the lab so i think a lot of
61,people when they start doing their phd
61,think that it's going to be very similar
61,to undergrad you're going to go to class
61,you're going to go do some research and
61,you know you'll be there from nine to
61,five and then you could go home maybe do
61,a little bit of studying and that's
61,about it
61,and you think oh this is great you know
61,i go to work i show up i get my stipend
61,you know everything is really nice and
61,what you don't realize is that it's not
61,going to be a 40 hour work week um it
61,hardly ever will be actually as you do
61,grad school and a postdoc it's it's
61,almost always going to be more than 40
61,hours a week and it's going to be really
61,hard to explain to your peers and to
61,your parents and and friends that you
61,know you're still in school yeah but
61,it's not like school what you're used to
61,it's not you just show up to class and
61,take a test and then you're done
61,there's quite a lot that goes into it
61,and you're going to be constantly
61,working and you're going to constantly
61,be needing to put in overtime and and
61,this is just one of those things i think
61,that the really junior people are just
61,not totally prepared for
61,the final truth is that
61,it's the most rewarding thing and i know
61,this is kind of like a cop out you know
61,kind of gimme but what i want to say is
61,that
61,the reward is more than just feeling
61,good about yourself that you are
61,able to finish a phd
61,so one of the things that i've actually
61,talked to people about and i think is a
61,common occurrence across people that do
61,a phd
61,is that it's more than just the science
61,when you do a phd
61,whether it's in a lab meeting
61,a one-on-one with a pi
61,a department meeting whatever it is
61,there's going to be a lot of times and
61,at some point it's going to hit you
61,differently where you get up and you
61,give up a talk and you're going to get
61,completely torpedoed what i mean by that
61,is you're gonna get up there and you're
61,gonna feel like you're the stupidest
61,person in the room you're gonna have
61,people left right in the other basically
61,you know pooping all over your uh your
61,work and this is something that happens
61,to everybody when they do their phd
61,part of doing a phd is being torn down
61,and then being rebuilt up and that's
61,going to happen to everybody and it can
61,be humiliating it could be exhausting it
61,could be mentally you know taxing
61,but at the end of it after you've been
61,broken down and you start to realize
61,what you know
61,and realizing what you don't know and
61,you start rebuilding your way back up
61,there when you get to the end it is
61,really really rewarding your outlook and
61,views on the world will be forever
61,changed especially when you start
61,factoring in things that have nothing to
61,do with science like for example you may
61,be traveling internationally to do your
61,degree or you may be within the same
61,country but you may be exposed to many
61,different
61,ideas and religions and perceptions that
61,you never would have been
61,you're gonna be
61,challenged with new ideas you're gonna
61,make friends with all different people
61,you never thought that you would and
61,you're gonna come out looking at the
61,world differently
61,it's gonna forever change you and i
61,think that this is something that just
61,doesn't get talked about is that a lot
61,of people think that doing a phd is like
61,going to high school or college and you
61,go when you take classes and you study
61,it yeah i got my degree when you're done
61,and that's not what it is
61,doing a phd it's
61,rewiring the brain
61,you're going to look at everything in
61,the world differently and there's no
61,going back once you go through it and so
61,my advice is that yeah you know your pi
61,might make a difference there is going
61,to be politics there's going to be long
61,hours there's other unspoken truths that
61,are out there that i didn't even cover
61,in this video but at the end of the day
61,it's all going to be worth it so just
61,keep plugging through keep going you
61,know for anyone watching this video you
61,obviously care enough about your career
61,to be you know searching for different
61,topics related to doing a phd i think
61,that that just puts you ahead of
61,everybody else and i think that you're
61,gonna do a really great job so with that
61,i'm gonna catch you guys in the next one
61,as always give this video a thumbs up if
61,you like it make sure to leave comments
61,below what you think about these truths
61,and let me know if there's any kind of
61,questions that you guys have out there
61,that i haven't addressed yet and i'll
61,catch you in the next one bye
62,welcome back everybody i hope everyone
62,that's in the u.s had a great
62,thanksgiving today we have a really good
62,video and i think this is something that
62,could help with most everybody but i
62,think is really going to cater to those
62,that are in the early stages of their
62,career and that's talking about the
62,scientific journey so what are the
62,stages you know if you're somebody
62,coming from undergrad what is grad
62,school the difference between a phd and
62,a master's what is this thing of a
62,postdoc that you hear about what are the
62,career opportunities that you have
62,afterwards you know let's dive into all
62,this let's talk about you know what is a
62,scientific career journey for a beginner
62,let's just lay it out there so
62,if you're watching this you're probably
62,at least in undergrad right now doing
62,science and thinking about you know what
62,can my next career step be
62,so of course a lot of us go into
62,undergrad into science thinking about
62,things like medicine or nursing or being
62,a dentist or a vet something like that
62,something in the medical profession
62,however
62,you do have the opportunity to pursue
62,science as science
62,so with that you could do one of two
62,things you can either go get a master's
62,degree or a phd so let's talk about
62,first the differences between the
62,master's degree and the phd so let's
62,start with the masters there's really
62,two types of masters that you could get
62,there's a research thesis based masters
62,and a non-thesis masters so what's the
62,difference so the non-thesis masters is
62,the closest that you're gonna get to
62,undergrad essentially what it is is
62,after you're done undergrad
62,you'll be able to either con you know
62,right after you're done or sometime in
62,the future you know online or something
62,take
62,x amount of credits
62,towards getting a master's degree and
62,that's it there's no lab work or
62,anything else it's just you take some
62,classes and then you're done
62,now
62,the amount of credits that you're going
62,to take are going to depend but you're
62,really going to be taking the core
62,competencies so things like genetics and
62,maybe
62,biochemistry cell biology things like
62,that um if you're a chemist there's
62,going to be chemistry things like
62,organic and organic physical chemistry
62,you know whatever they are
62,and after you're done
62,you'll you'll get your grade and then
62,you'll get your diploma you'll be a
62,masters in biology or chemistry or
62,whatever it is
62,now for an exact same diploma
62,you could do something called a
62,thesis based
62,degree which essentially means that you
62,have to take those core classes but then
62,you also have to perform some level of
62,research
62,and write a thesis on it so
62,a typical master's degree that's
62,non-thesis
62,maybe is going to take a year and a half
62,to two years to complete
62,whereas a
62,uh
62,thesis-based master's degree is going to
62,take about three years to complete maybe
62,three and a half years
62,and the biggest difference really is the
62,time it takes to actually do that
62,research
62,now which one do i recommend doing it
62,depends
62,so if you're somebody that has been out
62,of school for a while you're working and
62,you just want to advance your career
62,maybe it's worth on the side doing the
62,non-thesis
62,option master's degree so you know
62,you've been out of school for 15 years
62,and you realize that you want to move up
62,a little bit higher get a little bump
62,and pay so you want to get a master's
62,degree on the side while you're working
62,do the non-thesis if you're coming right
62,out of school you're probably going to
62,want to do that thesis-based option and
62,the reason is that once you're done
62,you're going to be able to be set up for
62,uh
62,working in a lab you actually have built
62,some lab experience and that's really
62,important when someone's trying to hire
62,you to be able to demonstrate that you
62,could do x y or z within a lab that
62,that's actually a really important skill
62,maybe even more important than the
62,classes that you take
62,um so that's something that you really
62,should consider
62,now
62,if you're a bachelor's or a master's
62,degree what are your kind of career
62,options if you will the bachelor's
62,degree is going to have
62,maybe the smallest choice so with a
62,bachelor's degree
62,you could go work in industry you could
62,go right out of your bachelor's degree
62,go start working in industry there are
62,positions in government
62,so for something like the fda or cdc
62,there's positions available at the nih
62,um
62,there's positions available in academic
62,labs that you can go to like a lab tech
62,so there's options out there for you
62,now getting your master's degree is
62,going to open up more
62,options for you so if you get your
62,master's degree now you put yourself in
62,a position where if you go into industry
62,you could get a little bit higher of a
62,title and pay some more responsibility
62,you could again go into an academic lab
62,if you go into
62,into
62,you know working for the government or
62,something maybe you could get a little
62,bit of a better position but that's sort
62,of where you're gonna go
62,um the difference between the bachelors
62,and masters in terms of pay is actually
62,fairly substantial there may be even a
62,a bigger jump between the bachelors and
62,masters than there is between a masters
62,and phd at least at first um over time
62,the phd will will outperform but you
62,know up front maybe the difference isn't
62,quite as big but this is something that
62,you know you should consider now
62,the next option is a phd so
62,first of all do you need a masters in
62,order to get a phd
62,there's really two two schools of
62,thought
62,there are some programs that think that
62,a master's degree or some level of
62,working
62,in a lab you know maybe an industry or
62,something after you're done is going to
62,help
62,and they want to see that before they
62,would admit you for a phd
62,and there are people that have that
62,school of thought now i've also talked
62,to some other people that are on
62,admissions committees that say the
62,opposite that they think that the best
62,candidates are the ones that are you
62,know coming right out of undergrad did
62,really well in undergrad know what they
62,want and go in to the phd and they think
62,that the people that did a master's
62,maybe are people that really can't quite
62,figure out what they want in their
62,future and so they're not as likely to
62,take them so there really isn't a one
62,size you know shoe fits all it's
62,probably gonna depend on the type of
62,program and who's on that admission
62,committee so it's hard to give a real
62,concrete answer to that
62,however
62,what you can do is either after your
62,bachelor's or your master's is you could
62,go for a phd now how is a phd different
62,than a master's so
62,at first it's going to be the same so
62,what you're going to be doing is you're
62,going to be taking classes on core
62,competencies
62,the difference is that that will end for
62,a master's whereas a phd will go on to
62,take even more advanced classes that are
62,specialized for the type of research
62,you're doing so if you're in a
62,immunology lab you're going to be taking
62,some very hardcore immunology coursework
62,if you're somebody like me that was in
62,physiology i took some very hardcore
62,physiology work some of it was directly
62,done with my pi
62,um who would teach the physiology to me
62,so you're going to be going really in
62,depth in a very specific area so that's
62,the first difference
62,the second difference is that unlike a
62,master's degree you're going to have
62,something called qualifying exams or
62,preliminary exams or prelims quals
62,prelims sometimes you even have both but
62,what those are are basically
62,a weed out it's uh you're going to every
62,place is going to have it set up
62,differently but it's going to be a
62,mixture of
62,oral questions and written questions and
62,the questions are going to be about your
62,own research they're going to be about
62,the coursework that you took or just
62,about science at large so i've seen
62,qualifying questions like write a grant
62,proposal for x
62,um or very open-ended questions um
62,and what it's meant to do is to decide
62,if
62,the committee that you have
62,that's overseeing your your phd work
62,thinks that you are ready to move on to
62,the final stages of doing your degree
62,and there are people that don't pass
62,this that that literally they don't pass
62,and what ends up happening is they leave
62,with a master's degree
62,now every school handles this
62,differently and so again you can't
62,really make a blanket statement about
62,how qualifying exams are if you want i
62,could always make a separate video
62,dedicated to qualifying exams because
62,this is a real huge part of your degree
62,and it is really intense
62,um so let me know in the comments below
62,if you want to see a whole video just
62,dedicated to preliminary slash
62,qualifying exams
62,but once you've finished that you're
62,what's considered abd all but
62,dissertation which means that at that
62,point all that you have left to do is
62,finish your research
62,and write and defend your dissertation
62,so at this point you've done your
62,classes you probably had some rotations
62,where you did work in a few different
62,labs and now you're centralized in one
62,lab doing a core project now the
62,difference in research for your phd
62,versus a master's is quite different so
62,with the masters it's going to be
62,more than what you would normally do for
62,example like in a lab in school and
62,you're trying to answer a specific
62,scientific question but it's you know
62,maybe at most you're going to be
62,tackling
62,part of a paper or maybe one paper's
62,worth of of experiments whereas in a phd
62,you're probably churning out data that's
62,enough for two to three papers plus some
62,co-authorships like it's a lot bigger
62,and more comprehensive
62,of a you know
62,of a topic that you're going to be
62,covering
62,and along with that there's also other
62,differences we've talked in previous
62,videos about when you do a phd how
62,you're going to be kind of torn down and
62,then rebuild back up to some degree that
62,happens with the masters but not quite
62,the same ways when you're doing a phd so
62,a phd you're really really not just
62,learning the scientific method but they
62,really rewire your brain to think in a
62,different more critical way
62,where you don't get that same level of
62,detail when you're doing a master's now
62,phds are going to take varying levels
62,somewhere between four and seven years i
62,would say four years is a really fast
62,phd
62,seven is pretty slow you're probably in
62,the middle at five or six is going to be
62,most people
62,um
62,that sounds about right to me now once
62,you've finished your phd what are your
62,options well
62,the very traditional ways to do a
62,postdoc
62,there's other things you could do as
62,well you could go right into government
62,for example you could go work at a
62,scientific
62,journal and be an editor so for example
62,if you submit a journal article to sell
62,press it has to go through an editor
62,that's going to screen them decide if
62,it's worth sending out to peer reviewers
62,and they kind of oversee the development
62,of that paper you know they need phds
62,for that you could go into contracting
62,you could go into
62,um the nih or the dod the department of
62,defense needs scientists there's you
62,know a lot of different areas that need
62,scientists um so there's a lot that you
62,could do with it now
62,for those that don't go directly into
62,those areas the very traditional path is
62,to do a postdoc this is what the
62,overwhelming majority of people do
62,after they're done with their degrees
62,they do a postdoc so what is a postdoc
62,you can think of a postdoc as continued
62,mentoring it's basically where you
62,continue learning but while you're
62,learning you actually have
62,you know
62,some level of of overview from somebody
62,that has experience so i say someone
62,that has experience and we'll get into
62,that in a moment so there's really two
62,kinds of postdocs there's an academic
62,postdoc and there's an industry postdoc
62,and in a video coming up i'm actually
62,going to talk about the differences
62,between the two and why you may want to
62,choose one or the other but if you do an
62,academic postdoc you're obviously going
62,to be working with somebody that's a pi
62,they're a professor and if you go to an
62,industry postdoc you're going to be
62,working with some scientist or director
62,that you know is in industry and so
62,you're going to be learning two
62,different skill sets one is for academia
62,one is for industry now that's not to
62,say that you can't switch so like myself
62,i did an academic postdoc and then went
62,to industry you know a lot of people do
62,that actually
62,um
62,so it's not like you can't switch but
62,you know those are the two different
62,types now what you're really doing is
62,you're learning how to
62,use the skills that you learned in your
62,phd under the supervision of someone
62,else so let's take an academic postdoc
62,for example
62,you've gotten your phd
62,you really have a decent grasp on the
62,scientific method and some of these
62,basic techniques that you may want to
62,use and how to develop a project but
62,what you need to do is you need to you
62,know basically practice with training
62,wheels before the training wheels get
62,taken off so before you could be a pi
62,yourself and be writing grants and
62,running a lab you need to practice so
62,what you do is you go into a postdoc and
62,that's what you do you practice grant
62,writing manuscript writing developing a
62,new project overseeing the growth of
62,that project not just for one paper but
62,what would be the next 10 to 20 years of
62,that project and you practice doing all
62,of this and if you have a pi that is
62,really good what they do is they
62,gradually will give you more autonomy so
62,they'll first start taking over your
62,work as if you were a grad student where
62,they're you know fairly hands-on and by
62,the end they should be fairly hands-off
62,and letting you make most of the
62,decisions for your own career because
62,you know they've trained you well so
62,it's a period of mentored science
62,and it's a really really important part
62,of your career and something that a lot
62,of people they do it and they just say i
62,just want to get it done but it's really
62,important this is really going to form
62,the basis of how well you can do science
62,to be honest um you really learn the
62,most critical thinking and lab skills
62,during your postdoc so it's not
62,something you should take lightly you
62,should really take your postdoc
62,seriously
62,then after that
62,you could go on to what would be your
62,next position so if you want to stay in
62,academia you can you could try to become
62,a pi a principal investigator someone
62,that runs a lab and you could
62,you know be a professor or you would be
62,an assistant professor but you could try
62,to get a professorship somewhere
62,now if you're at a research institute
62,your main role is going to be securing
62,grants and running a lab but you could
62,also be you know an assistant professor
62,at a teaching school so a school that's
62,not really focused on research but it's
62,more uh has a focus on education where
62,you're mostly just teaching classes
62,you can go into industry and you can
62,work as a scientist in industry you
62,could go to the fda you could go to a
62,whole bunch of different places um
62,but that's really the gist of the
62,scientific journey so from undergrad
62,into either you know working or doing a
62,master's or what's the difference
62,between a master's and a phd and then
62,into a postdoc and then further these
62,are some of the different options that
62,are out there and if anyone wants you
62,could leave a comment below we could
62,actually spend an entire video or
62,multiple videos going over
62,specific career paths after doing your
62,phd or postdoc because there's actually
62,a lot of out there the majority of
62,people yes are gonna probably end up
62,doing
62,academia or industry that is by far the
62,most common paths that you're going to
62,take and probably i would assume make up
62,at least 80 percent of phds out there
62,but there's still a good chunk that of
62,people that do other things so let me
62,know again down in the comments if
62,that's something else that you want to
62,see
62,with that i'll catch you guys in the
62,next one bye
63,welcome back everybody so in the last
63,video we uploaded what we talked about
63,was the scientific journey for beginners
63,so basically how to go from undergrad
63,through you know a master's and phd
63,postdoc and to work in academia industry
63,and i think this is a very important
63,video but one point that we got to was
63,the postdoc era so basically once you're
63,done with your phd if you don't want to
63,start working it and you want to
63,continue with mentored scientific
63,development you go and you do a postdoc
63,and we talked about that there is an
63,academic postdoc and that there's an
63,industry postdoc and so basically what's
63,the difference between the two and i
63,didn't really touch on it in that video
63,in depth because i actually wanted to
63,make this video which is going to go
63,really in depth um
63,the
63,what are the differences between the two
63,and the pros and cons of each so let's
63,kind of get into that if you like this
63,kind of video give it a thumbs up if you
63,have questions about this make sure to
63,leave them in the comments below or
63,other questions that you may have leave
63,them in the comments below this is
63,something that i thought about maybe
63,making a video on and someone actually
63,did ask specifically about this so now
63,i'm making a video on it because i think
63,maybe some of you may want to know what
63,the differences are some of you may not
63,even realize that you could do a postdoc
63,in industry i know that i didn't know
63,that until much later in my career so
63,for those of you that don't know yes you
63,can in fact do a postdoc in industry so
63,let's first set up with what is a
63,postdoc so that's the first thing that
63,we should address what is a postdoc then
63,what we'll do is we'll talk about what a
63,postdoc is in academia and why you may
63,want to do one there and then we'll talk
63,about what a postdoc in industry looks
63,like and why you may actually want to do
63,one there
63,so
63,what is a postdoc a postdoc is an area
63,of you know your training where you can
63,continue scientific development under
63,the guidance and mentorship of some
63,individual okay
63,so the idea is you have basically
63,finished your phd
63,so you've kind of molded the way that
63,you critically think about science
63,you've learned some you know in-depth
63,area
63,of research maybe it's metabolism or
63,cancer or
63,immunology or plant growth you know it
63,depends what your you studied
63,you've done all of your core classes you
63,have an idea of the scientific method
63,you have an idea about you know how to
63,run a project
63,but now what you need to do before you
63,could go off on your own and make these
63,larger decisions on your own you need to
63,practice under somebody's mentorship
63,right riding with training wheels before
63,taking off those training wheels
63,so let's start with an academic postdoc
63,because i think this is the one that
63,most of you are going to be familiar
63,with so this is when you're going to
63,basically just like when you were in a
63,phd we're working with an advisor you're
63,going to go join somebody's lab
63,in in a department and you're going to
63,work for them
63,as a as a postdoc
63,so i did mine at the joslin diabetes
63,center at harvard medical school so i
63,wasn't taking any classes at harvard
63,there was someone who was a professor at
63,harvard and i joined her lab and i was
63,directly her employee and my job was to
63,go to work every day and do research in
63,her lab and then i would go to
63,conferences and write manuscripts and
63,grants and all of that
63,now
63,what do you do in your postdoc so
63,over 90 of your time is going to be
63,dedicated to
63,going ahead and working on
63,your research you need to develop a
63,project and generate data and then write
63,grants and papers off of that that's
63,going to be the majority of what you do
63,90 some percent generating data
63,practicing in the lab lots and lots of
63,lab work
63,now the other 10 is going to be a
63,mixture you're going to have grants that
63,you need to write
63,so you need to get funding
63,you're going to be writing papers you
63,obviously want to publish that's the
63,whole point of doing a postdoc is to
63,generate data in publish
63,you're going to be attending you know
63,seminars within the department you know
63,both
63,probably what you're used to sometimes
63,it's going to be people within your
63,institute or department that are
63,presenting sometimes it's going to be
63,external speakers
63,sometimes you may have data clubs where
63,you have a couple labs that get together
63,and discuss data you may have your
63,weekly lab meeting that you're going to
63,go to
63,that's going to make up the rest of the
63,time and then sometimes maybe you have
63,an undergrad student or a medical
63,student that comes in to do research and
63,you could oversee their work
63,and what's going to happen is you're
63,going to start your post-doc and you're
63,really going to have really hands-on
63,mentoring
63,they're going to be you know really
63,overseeing all of your work in the lab
63,they're going to be really you know
63,carefully monitoring what you do and
63,over time if you have a good mentor
63,for your postdoc is they should be
63,giving you
63,more and more freedom as you progress
63,until the very end when you're basically
63,have those training wheels off and
63,you're operating independently and you
63,no longer need to rely on them to make
63,the decisions for you that you're able
63,to make these broader decisions for
63,yourself
63,so that's really what should be
63,happening within an academic postdoc now
63,the reason that you would want to do a
63,academic postdoc is that
63,obviously you want to go into academia
63,now the nice thing about doing an
63,academic postdoc is that it translates
63,well whether you want to do academia or
63,industry so
63,if you want to go into academia
63,what you're doing is you're staying in
63,academia
63,you're able to generate grants and to
63,get a history of like submitting nih
63,grants for example and saying yes i can
63,be funded and i have funding to be able
63,to start up my own lab
63,it's really critical to be in an
63,academic postdoc however if you do want
63,to go over to industry you can't so a
63,lot of the skills that you learn within
63,an academic postdoc are going to
63,translate over pretty nicely
63,to a scientist's role in industry so you
63,can translate over so i would say the
63,nicest thing about doing an academic
63,postdoc is just that flexibility of
63,if you want to become a professor you
63,can't however if you're not sure
63,anything maybe you want to go into
63,industry you still have that option so
63,you basically have
63,no decisions been made for you you could
63,still do either one that's the nicest
63,thing
63,the other thing is that i think what it
63,does really better than what you will
63,get from an industry postdoc is set you
63,up to publish
63,so you're able to publish more papers
63,it's going to give you the option to
63,really dive deeper than you ever have
63,before into mechanism in industry they
63,don't care about mechanism quite as much
63,that's more of an academic question and
63,so if you really want to
63,learn how to identify a mechanism and
63,dive into it that's where an academic
63,postdoc is going to be helpful and that
63,does actually help as you move you know
63,even into industry being able to really
63,work critically through the process of
63,identifying mechanism is still a really
63,important skill set to have so it's not
63,like it's a wasted skill set or anything
63,like that
63,um
63,now
63,what
63,would be the flip side then what is a
63,disadvantage of of doing this well you
63,don't have any industry experience so if
63,you do end up deciding to go into
63,industry it's not like it's impossible
63,but it is much harder than if you
63,started off in industry one of the
63,things that they always always look for
63,in industry is we want somebody with x
63,amount of years of industry experience
63,and if you've done a postdoc industry
63,they count that as industry experience
63,the reason that they want that is not
63,because
63,you're a better scientist if you're an
63,industry it's it's nothing like that
63,it's just it's a different world the
63,lingo and the dialogue is different the
63,expectations are different the pace is
63,different what's important to them in
63,terms of scientific inquiry is different
63,everything's much different in industry
63,and they want someone that has
63,that experience okay
63,so
63,when would it be a good idea to do a
63,post-second industry
63,that is really for somebody that knows
63,deep down i don't want to be a pi my
63,dream is to go into industry and work in
63,industry and if you already know that's
63,your goal some of you may be able to
63,just make the jump directly from your
63,phd
63,into a scientist position especially if
63,you have connections there are people
63,that do that now that is really really
63,hard typically you need a postdoc
63,position
63,and in fact pretty much everyone has a
63,postdoc position and so they don't even
63,consider that years of experience
63,because pretty much everyone applying
63,for these positions has three years or
63,or more of a postdoc experience
63,so
63,what is an
63,industry postdocton so again instead of
63,going to a department at an ins at a
63,university you would be going to a
63,company so let's say that you go to
63,pfizer you know pfizer is one of the
63,biggest companies in the world you could
63,go to pfizer and you could go to their
63,internal medicine unit within pfizer
63,and what you would do is you would be
63,paired up with either a high-level
63,scientist or some kind of a director or
63,vp
63,and they would basically be overseeing
63,your work and it would be a postdoc for
63,x amount of years and essentially what
63,it is is it's going to be training where
63,you're continuing again similar to
63,in academia you're continuing to develop
63,those scientific skills working that
63,scientific method and again similar to
63,academia it should start very hands-on
63,and then start to transition to a more
63,hands-off you know type of role now the
63,difference is the extracurriculars that
63,you do
63,so your research may not necessarily be
63,focused on mechanism it may be more
63,focused on drug delivery or something
63,specific to a druggable target so the
63,type of research you're doing is going
63,to be different
63,you're going to be attending different
63,kinds of meetings right so you're not at
63,an academic institute so some of your
63,meetings are going to be more towards
63,the company's pipeline and how are we
63,advancing this drug or that drug
63,you're going to get exposure to the
63,different scientists and vbs and
63,directors so you're going to get that
63,exposure to what is the
63,corporate lingo the company lingo the
63,dialogue what's important to the people
63,the scientists that are in industry
63,um and there's not going to be so much
63,as a focus on writing manuscripts
63,although that may be part of it but you
63,may get other expertise so for example
63,you may be able to
63,uh get a patent so you may be able to
63,you know discover something new and get
63,a patent form and be able to put that on
63,your cv where maybe you wouldn't get
63,that in in
63,academia
63,but
63,the biggest drawback i think to doing a
63,postdoc in industry is that you can't
63,then transition very easily over to
63,academia so if you go over to industry
63,it's hard to go back to academia because
63,you don't have that
63,um
63,any funding to stand on you don't have
63,any grants it becomes very very
63,difficult so i think that's really the
63,biggest drawback so at the end of the
63,day what i would recommend for for those
63,of you that are interested in in doing a
63,postdoc either in academia or an
63,industry is to think about your
63,long-term goal
63,if you want the possibility of working
63,academia then hands down the best
63,decision is to go the academic route
63,if you
63,are die hard set on i don't want to go
63,in academia i want to go into industry
63,then doing an industry postdoc is
63,probably the best choice
63,now where it becomes a gray area are for
63,those people that are not quite sure and
63,if you're really not quite sure again
63,just to leave all doors open i think
63,doing the academic post stock is
63,probably the best choice just because
63,you still have that flexibility of where
63,you want to go
63,but i hope this kind of answers the
63,question of like what are some of the
63,differences between the two and maybe
63,who should be doing which ones so i
63,think in almost all cases the best
63,option is to do an academic postdoc
63,really the only time you really want to
63,be doing that industry postdoc is if you
63,feel like
63,industry is the way i want to go like i
63,know i don't want to do anything else i
63,just want to go into industry then
63,sometimes it's a really good decision to
63,do those
63,um
63,now with that i'll catch you guys in the
63,next one if you have more questions
63,about this leave them in the comments
63,below and we could get into stuff like
63,that um you know for example there may
63,be other things i didn't mention like
63,pay so you're going to get paid more if
63,you do a post-second industry you know a
63,little extra tidbit there
63,um yeah i'll catch you guys in the next
63,one bye
64,welcome back everybody so today we're
64,going to do something a little bit
64,different today i was
64,sitting at work and i get emailed the
64,newest nature table of contents so for
64,those of you that don't know what you
64,could do is you could subscribe to
64,different journals scientific journals
64,and when they have a new table of
64,contents they'll email them to you and
64,you can browse through and see if
64,there's any articles worth reading to
64,you so one of the journals that i you
64,know look for is nature and the title of
64,the article was
64,industry scientists more positive than
64,those in academia and that really
64,caught my attention so i wanted to take
64,a look at what's going on so every year
64,or a couple years nature goes and they
64,survey scientists within industry and
64,academia
64,and they look for things like job
64,satisfaction and salary
64,and you know makeup in terms of gender
64,and nationality and they try to get like
64,a comprehensive view as to what the
64,scientific landscape looks like for
64,professionals
64,and somebody was commenting on the
64,findings in terms of
64,what you know
64,who's happier those in academia are
64,those in industry and so i'm going to
64,leave a link to this uh journal article
64,in the description below if you're
64,interested to read the whole thing but i
64,wanted to read a couple of parts that i
64,you know came across and i found really
64,interesting and kind of give my reaction
64,to those
64,so the first one is it says
64,scientists who work in industry are more
64,satisfied and better paid
64,than our colleagues in academia
64,according to the self-selected group of
64,respondents which comprise of more than
64,3 000 working scientists okay
64,so
64,i think that there's two parts to this
64,one is that there's better pay in
64,industry which i think most of us know
64,and then the second part is
64,that of the people that responded there
64,are more people happy in their position
64,in industry than there are in academia
64,now unfortunately
64,one thing that's missing from this
64,article and one thing that really needs
64,to be dissected apart is
64,why are people more happy is it just
64,monetary or is it things like grants so
64,for example a lot of pis feel really
64,burnt out writing grants that's the
64,reality is that nowadays you need to be
64,well funded to be able to run your lab
64,and it really you know it can burn out
64,pis so what is it that is making people
64,feel happier within industry versus
64,academia that's something that's not
64,really discussed here but i do find it
64,really fascinating especially because if
64,you continue on in this article what
64,they talk about is that job satisfaction
64,used to be pretty much on par with each
64,other
64,and i've seen that in other
64,situations before where they were pretty
64,much on par with each other but recently
64,there's been this big decrease in terms
64,of job satisfaction amongst those in
64,academia whereas in industry it stayed
64,the same or maybe even gone up a little
64,bit
64,so
64,why
64,is there this discrepancy well my
64,personal feeling again this is just my
64,personal feeling that's purely anecdotal
64,no real scientific evidence to back this
64,up is that i think it has to do with
64,hours worked
64,it has to do with flexibility and it has
64,to do with burnout
64,so
64,compensation so you're just compensated
64,better when you work in
64,an industry versus academia in terms of
64,flexibility what i mean by that is that
64,you do have flexib more probably
64,flexibility when you work in academia in
64,terms of like what you're actually going
64,to get to work on
64,um you know you get to pick which
64,projects your lab is going to drive
64,forward versus an industry you know
64,there's a board of directors and a
64,management team that's kind of coming up
64,with the direction of the company
64,um but what i mean by flexibility is the
64,ability to pivot and to move into new
64,areas that you maybe wouldn't be able to
64,normally so in terms of being a pi
64,you're going to be just you know maybe
64,doing some teaching and then running
64,your lab and it's the same thing you
64,know every day whereas in industry you
64,really get that ability to pivot and
64,learn new things pick up new skills you
64,really continue growing as a scientist
64,where i feel you you don't quite get the
64,same growth opportunity um in industry
64,and then in terms of burnout i think
64,that in an industry you do have to work
64,many hours but i think work-life balance
64,tends to be a lot better than it is in
64,academia where people are just non-stop
64,24 hours a day racing against each other
64,working and while people do work good
64,hours in industry meaning a lot of hours
64,it's it's not nearly as bad as it is in
64,academia in academia it can be out of
64,control how many hours people are
64,working a week
64,so the next thing i wanted to read which
64,i thought was really interesting and
64,this is something that
64,um
64,there's definitely
64,more of focus i think in industry than
64,in
64,academia on de i which if you're not
64,familiar is the diversity equity and
64,inclusion
64,and
64,trying to make sure that everybody feels
64,welcome not that it isn't there in
64,academia i just think they do a better
64,job in industry uncovering this and i
64,think this translates a little bit to
64,the next point which is another key
64,finding covered in this week's piece on
64,workplace diversity is that 30 of
64,respondents in academia reported
64,workplace discrimination harassment or
64,bullying compared with 15 in industry
64,um
64,that is you know
64,the number should be zero there
64,shouldn't be any kind of bullying or
64,harassment i mean it should be zero but
64,there's there's actually twice as many
64,people in in academia that feel like
64,they've been bullied or harassed
64,than there are in industry and i think a
64,lot of that just has to do with you know
64,the relationship between
64,um
64,mentor and student and
64,and in a work environment it's a little
64,bit different you know so if i'm at work
64,it's more of a team environment versus
64,in academia where it's me as a postdoc
64,in my pi or the pi who just kind of
64,autocratically runs the lab um or that
64,pi and then
64,the
64,you know department head um i have a
64,whole hr department i could talk to it's
64,a different professional setting whereas
64,i think in indus in a in academia we're
64,kind of trained to just
64,take whatever anyone says at us and i
64,know that a lot of post docs feel like
64,they are completely bullied and harassed
64,by their pi a lot of grad students feel
64,the same way and they think that they
64,kind of have to
64,take it just so that they could get
64,through and it's not really acceptable
64,but i think it's interesting that the
64,numbers show that there's just more
64,people in academia they feel like
64,they're getting bullied than those that
64,are in industry
64,um the next part i wanted to talk about
64,had to do with compensation and actually
64,we'll just tie these last two together
64,um basically
64,the this this first part it talks about
64,it's a supply and demand right laws of
64,supply and demand so in industry there's
64,just a flood of positions there's more
64,positions out there and then can be
64,filled and so to attract talent
64,there's this constant battle of trying
64,to one-up each other okay so you guys
64,pay this amount then we'll pay a little
64,bit more okay so your bonus is this
64,every year then we'll give a little bit
64,higher of a bonus this is what your
64,stock equity is we'll give more you guys
64,give free food once a week we'll give
64,you free food two or three times a week
64,you know you guys get to work from home
64,once a week
64,we'll have you work at home twice a week
64,there's all of these things not just in
64,terms of compensation
64,with a monetary value but also in terms
64,of just like perks like again like how
64,many days a week you could work at home
64,all the companies are always trying to
64,one-up each other and in academia it's
64,the opposite there are so few positions
64,available and so many postdoc positions
64,available so few faculty positions
64,available
64,that really they don't have to cater to
64,you at all because there's always
64,somebody willing to take the job for
64,less money than you are
64,and so because of this there's this huge
64,difference in compensation
64,now this doesn't always have to be a bad
64,thing so for example
64,um at the very end here of the article
64,they say of course many do find a korean
64,academia highly uh or hugely rewarding
64,one academic
64,bioinformatician in the united states
64,who responded to the survey reported
64,earning about 50 what she was offered in
64,industry okay so she works in
64,bioinformatics in academia she earns
64,about half
64,as what she would have earned if she
64,went to industry
64,um it would be nice if academia could be
64,more competitive with industry but i
64,love what i do and why where i am so i
64,can't complain
64,but as competition for scientific talent
64,increases academic leaders must not
64,assume that that sentiment will prevail
64,meaning
64,this individual maybe is okay
64,but
64,as compensation and industry continues
64,to increase if academia doesn't keep up
64,they're going to fall behind okay
64,if they want current and future
64,generations of academics to thrive they
64,need to learn how other sectors succeed
64,in recruiting retaining talent rewarding
64,staff and consider how to ensure they're
64,still attractive to top talent okay
64,this is the ultimate key to
64,to the article
64,there can be differences in satisfaction
64,between academia and industry
64,and there can be differences in terms of
64,uh
64,compensation satisfaction you know
64,they're not they're not going to be on
64,par they're two different worlds and
64,that's fine
64,the issue becomes
64,how can
64,academics retain top talent
64,because it used to be
64,10 20 30 40 50 years ago
64,that when you did a phd
64,you did it because you wanted to be a pi
64,and if you went into industry
64,it was because it was a lesser career
64,and because of that what
64,industry used to do is pitch a bit of a
64,higher salary okay you know people don't
64,necessarily want to come to industry so
64,what we'll do is we'll pay better so we
64,could try to attract talent
64,but nowadays
64,the view is different
64,and you have a lot of post-docs that are
64,like myself that are going in thinking
64,maybe that they want to
64,work in academia but then they look
64,across the aisle at industry and they
64,say huh
64,so you get paid
64,way more money than i would ever get
64,in academia
64,and you get a yearly bonus
64,and stock options
64,and you guys get free food
64,and you guys get to work home some days
64,and aren't required to always be there
64,and on and on and on and you start kind
64,of
64,lining up all the different things that
64,you get in terms of perks and
64,compensation and working in industry
64,and you look at that what the job is in
64,academia and it's like okay
64,well are there perks of the job well
64,yeah i you know want to be a professor
64,but then what else you know you
64,kind of slave away doing the grant
64,writing
64,that's not so fun you have to be on
64,you know panels for for judging grants
64,and do peer review for papers and you
64,know you start looking at it and it
64,starts feeling like
64,i don't know like i feel like i'm
64,getting a better deal over there in
64,industry and if academia wants to be
64,able to keep up and they want to be able
64,to really retain that top talent
64,they need to find a more competitive way
64,of doing so because what's happening is
64,they're falling too far behind what's
64,actually happening in in industry
64,so
64,i'm not saying all this because i
64,personally think you know
64,working in academia is not the right
64,track in fact several the videos we put
64,out on this channel are dealing with how
64,you can you know try to transition to
64,becoming a faculty member and i have a
64,lot of friends that are faculty members
64,and i think that it's it's a really good
64,opportunity if you can do it
64,but i do think that there is some truth
64,to this
64,article and these findings and the
64,findings seem to be real they were an
64,actual survey and that the satisfaction
64,in terms of your how happy you are at
64,work
64,seems to be higher in industry and a lot
64,of it has to do with job satisfaction
64,going down in academia and so the
64,question is and and what i'm interested
64,to hear from from you guys in the chat
64,is how can we boost
64,job satisfaction within academia because
64,you know even for industry to succeed it
64,relies on academia moving the field
64,forward right a lot of what happens in
64,industry is building off of that
64,academic field and a lot of the most
64,important findings come in academia so
64,we need a way to have both
64,industry and academia so how could we
64,really
64,make academia more appealing
64,before it kind of starts falling too far
64,behind
64,so just a
64,cool thought exercise so with that i'm
64,going to close this one up if you guys
64,like this video give it a thumbs up we
64,could do more of these kinds of reaction
64,videos
64,and i'll catch you guys in the next one
64,bye
65,welcome back everybody so today i want
65,to cover a topic that hasn't really been
65,talked about on this channel that much
65,and that's putting together your
65,dissertation now i think that when you
65,put together your dissertation there's
65,really two different ways of doing it
65,there's a okay way and then there's a
65,really good way of doing it so today
65,we're going to cover both of those if
65,you could think of a different way that
65,you could put together your dissertation
65,leave them in the comments below i'd be
65,interested to hear what other ways
65,people have put together their
65,dissertations
65,so for this let's just assume that you
65,are your
65,typical graduate student you've worked
65,on maybe
65,three projects or two projects and each
65,of them is going to be like its own
65,standalone paper they all kind of have
65,some loose thread that kind of ties them
65,together and you need to put them
65,together to write your dissertation
65,so what is the least efficient way of
65,doing that well the least efficient way
65,of doing that is to kind of try to tie
65,them all together into one story so you
65,would have a really big introduction
65,you would write you know a method
65,section for all the different
65,experiments that were done you would try
65,to put all your results together you'd
65,have one big discussion
65,um
65,and then you know maybe some future
65,directions that you know you think your
65,project should take
65,and then you know your acknowledgements
65,everything like that
65,i think that's the
65,maybe least efficient way of putting
65,together your dissertation and i
65,actually see a lot of people do that and
65,it becomes
65,a lot of extra work because you really
65,need to take steps to write every single
65,piece of your dissertation in that way
65,okay so what do i think is the more
65,efficient way of doing this
65,the way that i think is much more
65,efficient is what's called the chapter
65,method okay so what is the chapter
65,method so let's go back to our original
65,scenario of you have
65,two projects that you worked on and each
65,one is a paper okay so you have project
65,one project two and then maybe you have
65,some additional things that are project
65,three that you know wouldn't necessarily
65,get into your dissertation
65,what i think is the best way to do your
65,dissertation is the way that i did it
65,and you're gonna need to talk to your pi
65,and make sure that they're okay with it
65,and make sure that your committee
65,committee's okay with it but my pi and
65,my committee were okay with doing it
65,this way
65,essentially what i did was i
65,took my paper from
65,project one and i took my paper from
65,project two and i just put them right
65,into my dissertation so i had an overall
65,uh introduction that i wrote that was
65,about 20-ish pages
65,and then i had an overall conclusion
65,section
65,that kind of tied everything together
65,that was about 10 or 15 pages and then
65,in between i had chapter you know one
65,which was basically my first paper my
65,first project and then chapter two which
65,was my second paper my second project
65,and the reason that this is better is
65,that
65,your university will have a way that you
65,can you know without breaking any kind
65,of copyright just
65,basically copy and paste your paper into
65,your dissertation and this makes it so
65,much easier because then you don't have
65,to do all of that writing so for me i
65,had to do writing like the table of
65,contents and i had to like shift the
65,order that the
65,the uh graphs were in because they
65,couldn't they had to be at the end of
65,the of the dissertation so i had to like
65,move that around but in general i was
65,just copy pasting
65,uh the papers that i had already
65,published which made it a lot easier it
65,saved so many hours of work doing it
65,this way the other really good way of
65,reason to do it this way is that
65,one of the things that is always a
65,challenge as you get further into your
65,graduate school work is convincing your
65,committee that you have enough data for
65,dissertation they're always going to
65,want this experiment or that experiment
65,there's always something different that
65,they're going to want but if you have
65,two or three papers that you've
65,published
65,you kind of can work around that
65,obstacle because then each chapter is
65,just a published paper and they're not
65,necessarily going to be asking for more
65,in this one or that one because you've
65,already gone through the peer review
65,process and so you have a complete story
65,and in the eyes of you know academics
65,that have published so i think this is
65,definitely the much better approach
65,now this is a much shorter video but i
65,think it's something that i kind of
65,wanted to get out there because i i
65,think a lot of times i haven't on this
65,channel necessarily covered the
65,dissertation as a whole
65,and if you really want leave a comment
65,below let me know we could actually
65,spend a good amount of time going over
65,you know the actual defense of the
65,dissertation
65,which i think could be its own
65,standalone video
65,and another video that i think we should
65,make is one about qualifying exams so
65,let me know if that's something that you
65,guys want to see
65,with that i'll catch you guys in the
65,next one bye
66,welcome back everybody
66,i hope you're all doing great today i
66,want to get into something new which
66,i've kind of touched upon in other
66,videos but i think deserves its own
66,standalone video and that is about
66,choosing a pi to work with during your
66,postdoc
66,that is going to be a mentor now this is
66,gonna seem kind of convoluted to you if
66,you're reading the title you're gonna
66,think well of course like wherever i go
66,and i you know go to do a postdoc of
66,course my pi is going to be my mentor
66,but what i don't mean is like mentor and
66,name what i mean is mentor and action
66,so
66,let's kind of dive into this and talk
66,about how a lot of pis are
66,with their postdocs and how
66,you know a pi should be and for this i'm
66,actually going to draw on the pi that i
66,worked with for my postdoc who i think
66,she really
66,embodies what it means to be a mentor
66,for her post-docs so
66,when you're in graduate school
66,you know a lot of the pis that you work
66,with are going to care about you i think
66,more so than when you're a postdoc when
66,you get to the level of a postdoc
66,a lot of the pis look at you as a way to
66,really churn out data for their own
66,grants and to churn out papers for their
66,lab you are
66,sort of the labor for the lab if you
66,think about it right so if economic
66,currency in science is
66,how many ro ones you have and how many
66,papers you've published especially in
66,higher tier journals
66,the way that a pi can accomplish that is
66,by having postdocs that have success
66,then using that to snowball into getting
66,more funding
66,being able to get even more postdocs and
66,next thing you know they have 6 7 8 10
66,12 post docs
66,that are carrying out multiple projects
66,publishing in good journals and they're
66,able to snowball this into a lot of
66,publications
66,and into a lot of grants and that leads
66,them to be able to have you know
66,a bigger cv and ultimately move up that
66,ladder from assistant professor all the
66,way up to
66,you know a full professor
66,so a lot of them are going to look at
66,you in that light that they're hiring
66,you they're paying you they're not your
66,you know grad school advisor to hold
66,your hand you're there to produce data
66,for them
66,now
66,what that creates is this environment of
66,i think lack of really ingenuity
66,because what you do is you end up
66,looking at your pi as somebody who's
66,they don't care about you
66,they're just using you as a means to
66,their goal
66,and you put up with it because that's
66,what you need to do
66,to move on to the next step
66,however i think that some pis really do
66,go above and beyond in mentoring
66,so i want to talk about my experience
66,going through my postdoc
66,and kind of how
66,i think my
66,pi
66,was an excellent mentor now
66,when i first started
66,you know she let me know right away like
66,look i look at it is that you know
66,i'm going to really mentor that a
66,postdoc it's not just a postdoc it's
66,post-doctoral training and to do
66,post-doctoral training means that you're
66,going to be mentored and supervised and
66,that we're gonna you know work together
66,to move your projects forward
66,and
66,i think that what
66,she did was really
66,take that to heart
66,so
66,when i first started in the lab
66,i had so much experience with in vivo
66,work and my biggest weakness was
66,molecular work and so what she pretty
66,much did was said okay like yeah you
66,could continue doing a little bit of you
66,know in vivo work but really you need to
66,start mastering the things that you
66,don't know so here
66,here are multiple projects that are
66,involving you know really complicated um
66,you know molecular techniques and doing
66,cell culture and things that i've never
66,done before
66,pushing me to do things to broaden my
66,horizon
66,and as they worked you know
66,she would be happy with me and when
66,things didn't work she would work to to
66,help me figure out why i didn't and
66,ultimately if i ended up hitting
66,roadblocks
66,that's when she started to
66,work to reassign things to move me onto
66,this project or onto that project she
66,helped to really find what are the areas
66,that i can research and find success
66,right so that's really important is that
66,every person that's going to go through
66,a lab is going to have a different level
66,of success and if you're a pi and all
66,you care about is churning out papers
66,you really don't care about
66,having each person find their own level
66,of success what you care about is just
66,churning out papers
66,um and i think that i ended up being
66,more successful in her lab than if i was
66,working on the exact same project in a
66,completely different lab because she
66,really took the time to figure out what
66,are my strengths what are my weaknesses
66,and what are ways that i can work and
66,have success by using my strings
66,but also continue
66,to you know improve on the areas that
66,i'm weaker in
66,and over time i really could feel like i
66,had
66,tremendous growth in fact
66,when i went through my phd obviously i
66,grew and i think everybody's gonna grow
66,but i think the time period that had the
66,most scientific growth was during
66,my postdoc
66,especially during one-on-one meetings
66,that i had with with uh
66,with my pi
66,she really
66,can grill into you but i feel like i
66,really learned what did it mean
66,to think critically so i would think
66,critically after graduate school but
66,really with her was the first time that
66,i really began to look at things
66,in a totally different light than i ever
66,had before um and and you know again if
66,you have a pi that cares about you and
66,wants to mentor you they're going to
66,push you they're going to you know keep
66,digging and digging and digging until
66,you find a way
66,you know to move your stuff forward
66,it
66,and when you do that that's how you
66,learn to really think critically i don't
66,think that's going to happen when you
66,don't have a pi that's that really is
66,invested in your success
66,and ultimately
66,you know it was the way that i learned
66,how to
66,to think about science
66,that i eventually
66,landed on the or had the confidence to
66,then go ahead and say you know what like
66,i want to go into industry
66,that you know i didn't want to do
66,academia but now
66,i have these tools that i still use
66,today that i've learned here and i think
66,that i'm ready for a bigger challenge
66,and that's moving to industry because
66,all i had known at that point was
66,academia except for you know what i had
66,seen from maybe my my wife or from a
66,couple of colleagues i didn't quite know
66,as much about it and i had the
66,confidence to make that jump
66,because i had confidence in my abilities
66,from the training that i had received
66,and i think that if i was with a
66,different pi i wouldn't have really
66,built up that level of confidence if it
66,was a pi that really didn't care
66,and want to mentor me that just you know
66,wanted me to churn out papers i don't
66,think i would have been able to build up
66,that level of confidence certainly i
66,wouldn't have had the confidence that i
66,had to be able to start like this
66,youtube channel and to talk to all of
66,you guys about
66,you know what does it mean to be
66,successful as a graduate student or a
66,postdoc or or afterwards you know i i
66,wouldn't have
66,felt that i had been successful enough
66,to do that um
66,so you know i think this is
66,a long-winded way of really trying to
66,get across a specific point to all of
66,you
66,and that is
66,you're going to get
66,offers for
66,multiple postdoc positions i think that
66,everybody out here
66,can
66,find at least one if not two or three
66,postdoc positions out there at different
66,universities
66,one of the things that you need to think
66,about before you take
66,any role
66,is
66,does this pi
66,want to mentor me
66,because ultimately
66,that is going to really
66,dictate how you grow as a postdoc
66,and how much success you're going to
66,have afterwards
66,and i could tell you
66,that i have colleagues from the exact
66,same institute where i did my postdoc
66,that they
66,did not have pis that cared about them
66,and this isn't just something that like
66,they would tell you
66,the the post docs at that institute they
66,know who are the pis that care about
66,their
66,their postdocs and who are the pi's that
66,don't it's it's really obvious
66,um it's it's not a secret and it's like
66,this no matter where you go
66,um
66,i was very fortunate in that i think
66,more than maybe
66,any of the other
66,pis within the institute is she
66,genuinely cared about all of us she
66,really thought of all of us as her kids
66,um
66,if it was a deep connection that all of
66,us had all of us still have keep in
66,contact
66,and i think that because of that i was
66,more successful than i would have been
66,at the exact same institute with the
66,exact same opportunity exact same
66,projects but with a pi
66,that didn't want to mentor me
66,and so i think that this is something
66,that you definitely need to think about
66,so much so that i think that this needs
66,to be its own standalone video
66,um
66,so yeah with that um
66,i'll catch you guys in the next one if
66,you guys
66,you know have any thoughts about this

68,welcome back everybody
68,so i'm making a presentation right now
68,that i'm going to be giving to some
68,graduate students and it's about my own
68,scientific journey
68,and it's a talk of like a career shop
68,talk and it's about you know how did i
68,get to industry you know what was my
68,career path and it gave me a chance to
68,kind of reflect a little bit on my time
68,as a phd student and then my time as a
68,postdoc
68,and what i want to talk about in today's
68,video is my idea that i think
68,the culture around doing a phd needs to
68,change and i know that this isn't some
68,breakthrough idea i'm sure a lot of you
68,have the same opinion or once you finish
68,school you'll look back and you'll have
68,the same opinion
68,but i think that this is something that
68,i want to put out there as my own
68,viewpoint um on the journey of doing a
68,phd so
68,you know a while ago it used to be that
68,whether you were doing any kind of you
68,know terminal type degree so like law
68,school medical school graduate school
68,you kind of went through your own trials
68,and tribulation if you will so you would
68,work tons of hours have low pay
68,you know you would do the the dirt work
68,you know you put your
68,you do the dirty work right you do what
68,it takes to build up that toughness that
68,grit and really work your way up until
68,you were a freshly minted md or a phd or
68,whatever it is you know and then the
68,same kind of cycle continues again when
68,you do your post training so like if
68,you're a resident for medical school or
68,doing a postdoc you know the same thing
68,would continue
68,and i think that there is some
68,benefit to doing that i think that there
68,you know when i look back i'm not saying
68,that everything that i did in my phd
68,wasn't worth it i think that you know
68,putting in those hours was good i think
68,doing those really hard experiments it
68,really built grit and character and it
68,really changed my outlook a lot on on
68,what it means to do science and to
68,persevere and it's stuff that's applied
68,to the rest of my life the way i i look
68,at life is is very different and not
68,just because i am educated in science
68,per se
68,but going through that process is
68,something that that fundamentally
68,changes your brain i'm convinced of this
68,i'm sure that there's you know
68,actual studies that have been done in
68,terms of like white matter versus great
68,matter or what parts of your brain
68,change when you do a degree but i'm sure
68,that that there are anatomical
68,physiological changes that happen
68,there's biochemical changes there's
68,those just you know
68,a lot changes right and i think that we
68,could all appreciate that
68,but what's interesting is you know
68,in in medicine
68,when you
68,finish medical school and you do your
68,residency they used to work 100 hour
68,weeks 120 hours a week they would work
68,these unbearable types of hours where
68,it's like
68,you would be off and then you would work
68,for 24 hours straight then you'd get 12
68,hours off then you'd work a 30 hour
68,shift you'd work these you know really
68,long shifts
68,and what they found was that the doctors
68,were tired and were
68,basically killing people you know they
68,were so sleep deprived and tired they
68,were just making basic medical mistakes
68,and so they had to trim it back and now
68,they have laws you know at least in the
68,united states and i'm sure
68,europe is the same way
68,where they cap the amount of hours that
68,a resident can work
68,and this is for patient safety
68,but these types of safety nets haven't
68,been put in
68,for graduate students or people doing a
68,phd
68,and it's almost gotten to the point
68,where it's just such a big competition
68,right so in medicine yeah you're
68,competing against people maybe for a
68,grade or for a position at a you know
68,university but there's other positions
68,out there when it comes to doing a phd
68,it's one big competition there's a field
68,that you're in so maybe you're in the
68,field of breast cancer well there's only
68,x amount of people that could be the
68,best at breast cancer in the world and
68,so you just have thousands of people
68,competing for this spot
68,and so it's this never-ending perpetual
68,i need to publish more than the next
68,person i need to publish
68,you know instead of doing two papers and
68,you know maybe it used to be when you
68,did a phd one paper maybe two paper now
68,it's i need to do three or four papers
68,um and it's it's no surprise that when
68,you're doing research as a phd student
68,that depression rates have been on the
68,rise
68,that anxiety rates have been on the rise
68,that people are dropping out not because
68,they can't do the actual science but
68,because they just can't mentally take
68,the punishment that it takes to go
68,through doing a phd and going through
68,this gauntlet is just too much
68,um
68,you know and i
68,i feel for them that this is it's real
68,it's not something that's to make
68,believe in somebody's mind that
68,you know there's real
68,angst that goes through this
68,and you know i've talked about this in
68,other videos that you know if you go
68,through this you're not alone and i far
68,from it i think pretty much every single
68,person goes through it i'd be shocked if
68,there was someone that didn't go through
68,you know this kind of feeling as they
68,were going through their phd but what i
68,think needs to change is the way that we
68,look at what a phd is right
68,so a phd
68,doesn't need to be
68,working 100 hours in the lab
68,it doesn't need to be working 60 hours
68,in a lab even necessarily it doesn't
68,need to be
68,this angst and anxiety inducing thing
68,that you go through of course there's
68,going to be some anxiety and angst that
68,that happens when you're doing a phd but
68,it doesn't need to be to the level that
68,it is
68,at the core what a phd is is it's
68,teaching you how to think and behave
68,like a scientist how to think critically
68,how to analyze data and question data
68,how to
68,look at a complex problem and pinpoint a
68,way that you would address it using the
68,scientific method
68,these are the types of lessons that we
68,learn doing a phd
68,and i don't think that working
68,80 hours a week is necessary to answer
68,that i don't think that a grad school
68,advisor talking to you
68,you know like you are less than human is
68,necessary for that
68,i don't think that
68,you know being treated poorly by the
68,fellow post-doc in the lab or the senior
68,senior grad student that's about to
68,graduate is necessary for that
68,and so i think that we really need to
68,start rethinking the way
68,that we treat graduate students and how
68,we incentivize and what we're actually
68,teaching
68,right so this is a whole another video
68,that i want to make is sometimes the
68,lessons that we learn in grad school are
68,not applicable at all and then there's
68,other times where we're completely
68,missing major topics okay so if you're
68,doing a phd
68,you're going to be going to a job
68,whether it's a faculty position or
68,industry
68,or in government research you're going
68,to go into a job where you're going to
68,manage other people you're going to be
68,somebody's boss you're going to be
68,someone's supervisor
68,i don't know about you but i never
68,learned how to do that in my phd
68,i'm guessing none of you did either
68,and this is something that all of us are
68,gonna have to do at some point so why is
68,this never taught um you know it kind of
68,blows my mind
68,if you want to become a faculty member
68,you're going to have to spend a large
68,amount of time writing grants so if
68,you're doing a phd in the united states
68,why is it never taught how to
68,fundamentally put together a nih grant a
68,simple
68,fellowship or an r01 like why is this
68,never taught
68,um i don't understand unless you're in a
68,lab where you and your pi decide that
68,you're going to write some kind of a
68,grant together or he asks or she asks
68,you to review an r01
68,you're not exposed to any of that you
68,know it's sort of like the old argument
68,like you know i'm going through school
68,and they're teaching me the pythagorean
68,theorem but they're never teaching me
68,you know what i need to do to pay my
68,taxes um these basic skills that you
68,need to survive as a scientist aren't
68,really being taught in school
68,um and i think that some of this just
68,it's
68,we need to rethink how we're training
68,our scientists i think that there are
68,some fundamental flaws in the phd system
68,at the moment and they need to be
68,addressed
68,now again i don't have all of the
68,answers and this isn't meant to
68,provide anyone with all the answers
68,it's just that i have a medium to
68,put this out there on a youtube channel
68,and so i want to that you know
68,i think that
68,we need to change this so if you agree
68,give me a thumbs up let me know that you
68,also think that we need to change the
68,way that we do our phds
68,i think that there's a little bit of
68,toxicity in the way that we do it and it
68,needs to change i agree we need to build
68,up grid and perseverance and all that
68,and
68,fine but i think that there's better
68,ways that we could go about doing it
68,without burning out all of our phds
68,before they've even graduated
68,so i think that's enough rambling for
68,right now um you know i'll catch you
68,guys in the next one with more advice
68,for each of you but i kind of wanted to
68,put this out there this is just my own
68,self-reflection um you know nothing
68,scripted or anything just talking so
68,i'll catch you guys in the next one bye
69,welcome back everybody so today i want
69,to talk a little bit about networking
69,now this is something that we've talked
69,about before and i actually have
69,multiple videos on this so if you want
69,you could go back and check out some of
69,those earlier networking videos where we
69,talk about building a network or how to
69,network at conferences
69,but today what i want to talk about is
69,the importance of leaning into that
69,network and what that really means
69,and this concept of paying it forward
69,now
69,what i mean by paying it forward this is
69,a concept at least in the us that i've
69,seen before and i don't know you know
69,let me know in the comments below if
69,this exists elsewhere in the world i'd
69,be interested to know
69,this idea of paying it forward meaning
69,if you're at a drive-through to get
69,coffee at a coffee shop
69,you may
69,go up to the window and say okay you
69,know here's money for my order but then
69,can you also pay for the order behind me
69,and then that person will
69,go up to the window and they'll find out
69,that their order was paid for maybe they
69,pay for the person behind them and so
69,you know you're taking care of those
69,people
69,around you okay
69,it's the same thing i think with
69,help as a scientist okay so none of us
69,got to where we are by ourselves we
69,needed help we needed help from
69,our pi
69,our grad school advisor our committee
69,from grad school students that we were
69,working with fellow postdocs colleagues
69,you know every step of the way that we
69,go no matter what our seniority is we're
69,gonna need help from those around us
69,and i think that we need to all accept
69,that and that's fine there's nothing
69,wrong with needing help but you know one
69,of the things that we need to keep in
69,mind is that while we do take help from
69,others we need to be just as good about
69,giving help back to those around us
69,so when you see somebody that's brand
69,new in junior and they don't know what
69,they're doing
69,remember that you also used to be in
69,that same position and offer to help
69,them out
69,even if they're multiple levels below
69,you
69,doing that and showing that level of
69,commitment to the people within your
69,organization
69,it's really what builds a good community
69,and the departments that i've seen that
69,have that whether it's in academia or an
69,industry it doesn't matter those are the
69,ones that that i feel are the best to
69,work at and have been successful and you
69,could tell when a group of people really
69,care about each other and want to pick
69,each other up and help you know if
69,somebody's uh maybe transitioning to a
69,new type of job and they don't know what
69,they're doing somebody wants to leave
69,work and go back to school to get
69,another degree
69,there's all different times when
69,they're going to rely on you for help
69,and you need to make sure that you can
69,go there and be there to support others
69,remembering that you've also used help
69,from others now
69,with that said
69,we need to discuss leaning into your
69,network now networking is one of those
69,weird categories that i've seen
69,a lot of
69,scientists struggle with
69,in business people use their network way
69,more efficiently than scientists do
69,they're totally okay
69,to network and to ask for favors from
69,others and to negotiate and as
69,scientists we don't like to do that we
69,kind of like to let our data speak for
69,itself
69,and i'll let my stuff you know here's my
69,data it speaks for itself and that's not
69,necessarily good enough you know there
69,are some really good papers that have
69,been published out there that didn't get
69,into cell nature science that should
69,have and vice versa papers that really
69,weren't very good that got into cell
69,nature science and shouldn't really
69,don't belong there
69,some of that just has to do with the
69,networking of the pi and how they're
69,able to build relationships with the
69,editorial team at some of these journals
69,um so i know that there are pis out
69,there that have great relationships with
69,the editor and chiefs at some of these
69,journals and half their papers wind up
69,in those journals even though you know
69,the majority of them really don't belong
69,there the opposite is true there are
69,some pis that just submit a paper and
69,they say well i think it's good data
69,hopefully it gets in
69,and it doesn't because the pi doesn't do
69,anything to try to work to get the paper
69,in
69,and that's what the difference is and
69,it's the same thing with applying for
69,jobs it's the same thing with trying to
69,get grants sometimes you have to throw
69,your weight around a little bit and and
69,use your network and those around you to
69,help you obtain
69,the next step up in your career the next
69,grant the next paper it's okay to do
69,that it is okay to go to somebody that
69,you know within your network and say hey
69,i'm doing x y and z and i know that
69,you're connected in some way can you
69,help me out you know i want to apply for
69,a job at this university or at this
69,company and you know you're somebody
69,that knows someone in that department
69,can you help me out um
69,you know a really good example of this
69,is
69,one of the people that reports to me at
69,work
69,let me know that she wants to go back
69,and do a phd which is great i'm really
69,happy for her and she's leaning into her
69,network including myself to find
69,opportunities to do a phd and it happens
69,to be that i know
69,somebody that's in charge of a admission
69,committee at one of the universities and
69,so i was able to connect her with the
69,person in charge of an admission
69,committee and
69,now she has you know interviews there
69,and then what happens afterwards is up
69,to her but at least i'm able to help her
69,get her foot in the door i'm able to
69,generate that connection and put a name
69,and face together for that person so the
69,committee knows who she is
69,and it just means that she's at a
69,competitive advantage as opposed to
69,somebody that's just applying with no
69,connection at all
69,and that's what i really mean by using
69,your connection it doesn't mean that
69,somebody's gonna like lay out a job for
69,you and and give it to you it just means
69,knowing
69,who
69,who is in the arena that could help you
69,any little competitive advantage that
69,you could get is going to work to your
69,benefit and it's going to help you to
69,progress faster in your career it's
69,going to help you reach new heights and
69,it's going to make for a better
69,experience
69,that said bringing it back to the first
69,part of the video though as we do this
69,we need to remember that
69,um nothing in our career is done all by
69,ourselves
69,we always are relying on those around us
69,to help and so when we do
69,see somebody that needs help
69,sometimes those people aren't gonna go
69,out seeking the help sometimes we need
69,to be proactive and say how can i help
69,you
69,okay so how can i help you with this
69,that or the other
69,and sometimes by being proactive it's
69,good it feels good that you help
69,somebody it's the right thing to do
69,but even if you come at it from a
69,selfish angle sometimes if you go out of
69,your way to help somebody
69,you know it ends up making it where
69,they're more likely to help you in the
69,future if you ever need their help so
69,i'll give you an example when i was
69,considering moving from academia over to
69,industry
69,um
69,there was a company that we collaborated
69,with quite frequently and i got to know
69,the cso of that company really really
69,well
69,now the work that they did really wasn't
69,the same area that i was in so it
69,wouldn't have made sense for me to go to
69,that company
69,but when i was gonna move over i talked
69,to that cso and i said you know look
69,like i'm i want to move to industry you
69,know can you give me any help and he
69,spent time going over my cv and helping
69,me fix up my cv and gave me some
69,examples of like what an industry cv
69,should look like he he connected me with
69,some people that can talk to me about
69,different positions and different
69,companies
69,he
69,you know walked through what some of the
69,questions might be that i might get
69,asked at an interview and he really
69,helped a lot um more than he really
69,needed to but because he was so kind and
69,willing to help me with that
69,down the road he's come back and asked
69,me for help you know i need help finding
69,someone for this position can you help
69,me out and i'm very willing to do so
69,because i remember what he did for me
69,when i needed help
69,so i think no matter what your angle is
69,is you're helping someone if it's for a
69,selfish reason fine whatever if it's for
69,just feeling good and because it's the
69,right thing to do which is you know
69,that's a good thing um
69,it's good to help those around us and to
69,remember that we didn't really get
69,anywhere without the help of others
69,so i think that's about it for this
69,video but i just kind of wanted to
69,discuss this a little bit
69,so with that i'll catch you guys in the
69,next one bye
70,welcome back everybody so today i want
70,to get into the topic of professionalism
70,now this is something that i've seen
70,happen time and time again that's kind
70,of hindered some people and what you
70,want is to come off as professional
70,meaning that you're in a workplace and
70,you take that work very seriously you
70,don't want to come off that you're like
70,at the bar with your friends right so
70,how do we do that how do we come off as
70,being more professional okay
70,so in today's video that's what we're
70,going to tackle is what i think are five
70,quick and easy ways for you
70,to kind of come off as being more
70,professional
70,the first one is your appearance
70,so the you know humans are our visual
70,creatures the first thing we're going to
70,do is judge somebody based on their
70,appearance
70,now that's not to say that to be
70,professional you have to go to lab in a
70,suit in fact that would be kind of odd i
70,don't really see anybody wearing a suit
70,in the lab
70,but you want to try your best to
70,give the appearance that you care about
70,the work that you're doing so maybe
70,instead of wearing um
70,old sneakers and
70,jeans with rips in them and t-shirts
70,with holes in them
70,maybe you want to invest a little bit of
70,money and get a nicer pair of shoes
70,some jeans or some dockers or nicer
70,pants that are you know no fraying at
70,the bottom
70,no holes in them or rips
70,you know a nice even colored wash
70,something
70,uh like a button-down shirt or a polo
70,or nice sweaters or nice shirts you know
70,not just a nike shirt with holes all
70,over it that looks like something you
70,would wear to the gym
70,you know take the time to bathe
70,correctly we should all be doing that
70,but if you do that
70,you're gonna give off the impression
70,that you're you're a more professional
70,than if you're just simply wearing
70,clothes that you would wear to a bar or
70,something that you would wear to
70,you know the gym right so we want to try
70,to avoid that
70,the second thing is timeliness and
70,preparedness
70,there's a really good saying that i
70,heard
70,um from a football coach and it goes
70,like this it says
70,if you're
70,early you're on time if you're on time
70,you're late and if you're late you're
70,out of here
70,meaning that if the meeting starts at 12
70,o'clock
70,if you want to be on time to that
70,meeting you're there at 11 55
70,if you're there at 12 you're already
70,running late and if you get there after
70,12 that's not it you know it's
70,inexcusable you shouldn't be late now in
70,actuality yes sometimes you know you
70,have a meeting before that goes from 11
70,to 12 and maybe that meeting runs over a
70,minute and then you have to move to a
70,new room to get to the next meeting and
70,so you're a little bit late or maybe
70,something comes up in the lab that's
70,unexpected and so you're a minute late
70,to whatever meeting you're at
70,but in general
70,what you want to be doing is aiming to
70,always be on time which for a meeting
70,should actually be a couple minutes
70,early you don't want to be getting there
70,right when the meeting starts
70,so be early to your meetings
70,and when you come to whatever meeting it
70,is
70,make sure that you are prepared so if
70,you're having a one-on-one with your pi
70,you're going to want to have whatever
70,you know notes that you need to take you
70,know so a notebook pen paper you're
70,going to maybe want to have a list of
70,what activities you did for the last
70,week maybe at the
70,at your fingertips you're going to want
70,those data to be able to show them or
70,your eln your your lab notebook to show
70,them
70,you know whatever it is that you're
70,going to need to do with your pi you
70,want to have those ready you don't want
70,to be sitting there in the meeting
70,fumbling around trying to find anything
70,right because you know that's what
70,you're going to be discussing you want
70,to seem like you're prepared for that
70,meeting like okay if they ask about this
70,data this is how i'm going to show them
70,and i have that ready to go same thing
70,if you go to a meeting and it's about
70,you know planning for a seminar
70,discussion you're going to want to have
70,all of the different panelists that you
70,might want to be inviting ready to go or
70,whatever topics you want to discuss up
70,in this meeting ready to go whatever the
70,meeting is it's going to be different
70,but you're going to want to be on time
70,meeting early and you're going to want
70,to be prepared for that meeting and
70,that's also going to boost your
70,productivity and your organization as
70,well so this is a really good one
70,the next thing is
70,um
70,understanding
70,that you are not at a bar or out with
70,friends and that you're at work and
70,keeping your work conversations as
70,professional as you can
70,so
70,it's very easy for us to become good
70,friends and close with those around us
70,that we work with right so you're gonna
70,probably spend more time with the
70,co-workers that you work with and even
70,with your own family so you start to
70,become you know close with those that
70,you work with and that's fine that's
70,good you want to have good solid work
70,relationships
70,but what you want to remember is that
70,you are not at the bar with your best
70,friend so if you become friendly with
70,somebody at work so let's say that
70,there's a guy that i worked with there's
70,a few different guys
70,over my career that i've worked with
70,that i became friends with and we would
70,hang outside of work
70,the conversations we had outside of work
70,were different than what we had inside
70,work so when you're outside of work
70,you're you're you're out of the office
70,you can
70,talk and have fun the way you want but
70,when you're at work you've got to keep
70,it appropriate right so you gotta you
70,know watch the whatever kind of jokes
70,that you might make or offhanded
70,comments that you might make the
70,discussions you have at work should
70,really be focused around work and yeah
70,it's fine with your co-workers to get to
70,know them and talk about their family or
70,your family or you know talk about what
70,you did over the weekend
70,but you shouldn't be talking about
70,anything that's not you know really work
70,related um or or safe for for work
70,discussion
70,the next thing is keeping an open mind
70,to other viewpoints
70,so one of the ways that you could come
70,off as unprofessional or childish is to
70,not be open to new ideas okay so
70,as you
70,progress through your career you're
70,going to be exposed to more and more
70,people and more and more ideas
70,and
70,no matter how open-minded we try to be
70,there's always going to be people that
70,come and have ideas that are totally
70,different than ours they could be
70,religious viewpoints they could be
70,political viewpoints you know we're in a
70,scientific lab so there's always going
70,to be scientific discourse and there's
70,going to be debate that's what makes
70,science really good is that it's always
70,going to be a big discussion and you've
70,got to try your best
70,to let the data tell you
70,where you should be heading right and
70,that's a hard skill and it takes time
70,but eventually we get better at letting
70,the data tell us where we should go
70,but as we do that we're going to be
70,forming hypotheses right that that's the
70,scientific method we get data we think
70,about what it means and we form our next
70,hypothesis
70,and somebody might look at that same
70,piece of data and form a different
70,hypothesis or think that there's a
70,better way that you could test the
70,hypothesis even if they have the same
70,hypothesis
70,and just because someone has those
70,differences and ideas doesn't mean that
70,you need to just shut them out right
70,away because they don't have the same
70,idea it makes you come off as very
70,childish childish and unprofessional you
70,need to be open-minded to what others
70,are saying around you and think about
70,how you can incorporate those ideas into
70,your idea to make something even better
70,than what you originally came up with
70,and that type of collaborative like
70,effort and mindset is really
70,what's gonna set people
70,apart so
70,the the last point that i wanted to make
70,is that
70,science doesn't always work and
70,experiments don't always work
70,and it doesn't matter
70,how
70,long you've been in the lab
70,or how good you are in the lab
70,experiments are going to fail for one
70,reason or another sometimes things out
70,of our control sometimes things in our
70,control
70,but i could tell you as somebody that's
70,managed other people
70,um one of the big distinguishers between
70,somebody that's acts very professional
70,and someone that doesn't
70,is for the exact same experiment that
70,fails the unprofessional
70,individual will come to me and say
70,you know 101 reasons why it didn't work
70,when the the reality is that it's
70,something that they did or something
70,that they could control
70,and
70,the professional one is going to come to
70,me and they're going to say my
70,experiment didn't work i know why it
70,didn't work this is what happened i'll
70,make sure it doesn't happen again
70,and that's fine no one's going to be
70,upset because an experiment didn't work
70,that's part of science everybody in
70,science gets that even the hardest pi's
70,understand that not every experiment is
70,going to work but there's a big
70,difference between the person that takes
70,responsibility for it and says yeah this
70,is where i messed up i know this is what
70,went wrong i'll make sure it doesn't
70,happen again and the person that tries
70,to blame every other factor outside of
70,themselves
70,it's really
70,comes across as is not professional
70,so i think these are just five quick and
70,easy ways that we could try to act more
70,professional within a lab setting um if
70,you have others let me know down below
70,i'm interested to hear stories about
70,people and and and what you've come
70,across as being wow this seems really
70,professional like that's really good or
70,what you've seen and you're like oh like
70,this is not professional behavior um and
70,things that people should avoid
70,um and with that i'll catch you guys in
70,the next one bye
